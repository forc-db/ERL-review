## Summary
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# The Summary should be no longer than 300 words and divided into the following sections: Background, Methods/Design, Review results/ Synthesis and Discussion. Up to 7 Keywords should also be provided. The total length of the article is flexible.
```


*Background.* Earth’s climate is closely linked to forests, which strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and climate by their impact  on the global carbon (C) cycle. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO~2~ accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale data on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. 

*Methods/Design.* Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world’s forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use `r n_records` *ForC* records from `r n_areas_tot` geographic locations representing `r nrow(T1)` C cycle variables to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types (tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and taiga), including estimates for both mature and regrowth (age <100 years) forests. For regrowth forests, we quantify age trends for all variables.

*Review Results/ Synthesis.*  *ForC v3.0* yielded a fairly comprehensive picture of C cycling in the world's major forest biomes, with broad closure of C budgets. The rate of C cycling generally increased from boreal to tropical regions in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with stand age, *and the rate of increase again tended to increase from boreal to tropical regions*.

*Discussion.*  **NEED TO WRITE THIS!!!**

*Key words*: forest ecosystems; carbon cycle; stand age; productivity; respiration; biomass; global

## Background
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# The Background section needs to present the rationale for why a systematic review of this topic is needed along with a history of what has been done to date and an expectation of what new will emerge from the review, especially if quantitative meta-analyses of studies are being considered.
```

Forest ecosystems are shaping the course of climate change (IPCC1.5) through their influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO~2~).
Despite the centrality of forest C cycling in regulating atmospheric CO~2~, important uncertainties in climate models [@friedlingstein_climatecarbon_2006; @krause_large_2018; @bonan_model_2019; @di_vittorio_initial_2020] and CO~2~ accounting frameworks [@pan_large_2011] can be traced to lack of accessible, comprehensive data on how C cycling varies across forest types and in relation to stand history.
These require large-scale databases with global coverage, which runs contrary to the nature in which forest C stocks and fluxes are measured and published.
While remote sensing measurements are increasingly useful for global- or regional-scale estimates of a few critical variables [e.g., aboveground biomass: @hu_mapping_2016; **REF**; gross primary productivity, $GPP$: @li_mapping_2019; **REFS for biomass change, net CO2 flux**], measurement of most forest C stocks and fluxes require intensive on-the-ground data collection.
Here, we provide a robust and comprehensive analysis of carbon cycling from a stand to global level, and by biome and stand age, using the largest global compilation of forest carbon data, which is available in our open source Global Carbon Forest database (ForC; Fig. 1).

A robust understanding of forest impacts on global C cycling is essential. 
Annual gross CO~2~ sequestration in forests (gross primary productivity, $GPP$) is estimated at >69 Gt C yr^-1^ [@badgley_terrestrial_2019], or >7 times average annual fossil fuel emissions from 2009-2018 [9.5 $\pm$ 0.5 Gt C yr^-1^; @friedlingstein_global_2019].
Most of this enormous C sequestration is counterbalanced by CO~2~ releases to the atmosphere through ecosystem respiration ($R_{eco}$) *or fire*, with forests globally dominant as sources of both soil respiration [@warner_spatial_2019] *and fire emissions (REF)*. (**check if deforestation statistic below includes natural fire, exclude here if it does.**)
In recent years, the remaining CO~2~ sink averaged 3.2 $\pm$ 0.6 GtC yr^-1^ from 2009-2018, offsetting 29% of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions [@friedlingstein_global_2019].
Yet, this sink is reduced by *deforestation/ forest losses to anthropogenic and natural disturbances*.
Recent net deforestation (*i.e.*, gross deforestation minus regrowth) has been a source of CO~2~ emissions, estimated at ~1.1 Gt C yr^-1^ from YEAR-YEAR (Pan et al 2011; **UPDATE**), reducing the net forest sink to ~1.1-2.2 Gt C yr^-1^ across Earth's forests [@friedlingstein_global_2019].

The future of the current forest C sink is dependent both upon forest responses to climate change itself and human land use decisions, which will feedback and strongly influence the course of climate change. 
Regrowing forests in particular will play an important role [@pugh_role_2019], as these represent a large (**~#%**) and growing proportion of Earth's forests [@mcdowell_pervasive_2020].
Understanding, modeling, and managing forest-atmosphere CO~2~ exchange is thus central to efforts to mitigate climate change [@grassi_key_2017; @griscom_natural_2017; **Cavaleri et al 2015**].

Despite the importance of forests, comprehensive global studies have historically been limited by the scattered and more local nature of research studies. 
Primary research articles typically cover only a small numbers of sites at a time.
The rare exceptions that span regions or continents with rare exceptions spanning regions or continents are typically coordinated through research networks such as ForestGEO [@anderson-teixeira_ctfs-forestgeo_2015; e.g., @lutz_global_2018] or FLUXNET [@baldocchi_fluxnet_2001; e.g., **FLUXNET_REF**].
The result of decades of research on forest C cycling is that tens of thousands of records have been distributed across literally thousands of scientific articles --often behind paywalls-- along with variation in data formats, units, measurement methods, *etc.*.
In this format, the data are effectively inaccessible for many global-scale analyses, including those attempting to benchmark model performance with global data (Clark et al 2017, Luo et al 2012), quantify the the role of forests in the global C cycle [*e.g.*, @pan_large_2011], or use book-keeping methods to quantify actual or scenario-based exchanges of CO~2~ between forests and the atmosphere [@griscom_natural_2017; **REFS**].
Scattered data are not conducive for advancing science nor for making decisions about how to best manage our forests as a tool for constraining the climate crisis.

To address the need for global-scale analyses of forest C cycling, we recently developed *ForC* [@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016, @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
*ForC* contains published estimates of forest ecosystem C stocks and annual fluxes (>50 variables), with the different variables capturing the unique ecosystem pools (e.g., woody, foliage, and root biomass; dead wood) and flux types (e.g, gross and net primary productivity; soil, root, and ecosystem respiration). 
These data are ground-based measurements, and *ForC* contains associated data required for interpretation (*e.g.*, stand history, measurement methods).
These data have been amalgamated from original peer-reviewed publications, either directly or via intermediary data compilations.
Since the its most recent publication [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018], *ForC* has grown to include two additional large databases: the Global Soil Respiration Database [SRDB; @bond-lamberty_global_2010] and the Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment database [GROA; @cook-patton_mapping_2020] that also synthesized published forest C data.
Following these additions, *ForC* currently contains `r nrow(ForC_measurements)` records from `r nrow(ForC_plots)` plots and `r n_areas` distinct geographic areas representing all forested biogeographic and climate zones.
This represents an `r round((nrow(ForC_measurements) - 17367)/17367*100, digits=0)`% increase in records from the prior publication [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].

Here, we analyze the more extensive *ForC* data (Fig. 1) to provide a robust overview of stand-level carbon cycling of the world’s major forest biomes and how it varies with stand age.
Our primary goal is to provide a data-driven summary of our current state of knowledge on broad trends in forest C cycling. 
Specifically, we address three broad questions:

1. How thoroughly can we represent C budgets for each of the world's major forest biomes (*i.e.*, tropical, temperate broadleaf and deciduous, boreal) based on the current *ForC* data?

2. How do C cycling vary across the world's major forest biomes?

3. How does C cycling vary with stand age (in interaction with biome)?

While components of these questions have been previously addressed [@luyssaert_co2_2007; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016; @cook-patton_mapping_2020; @banbury_morgan_global_nodate], our analysis represents by far the most comprehensive analysis of C cycling in global forests, and will serve as a foundation for improved understanding of global forest C cycling and highlight where key sources of uncertainty still reside.

## Methods/ Design
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# The Methods/Design section needs to describe how articles in the reviews were identified and what criteria were used for justifying inclusion in the review. While traditional reviews relying on past experience and expert knowledge are acceptable, editors should encourage reviews that are set up as so-called ‘systematic reviews’ (see the Cochrane Review procedure which initiated the process in the medical and health science: http://community.cochrane.org/ about-us/evidence-based-health-care).
```


This review synthesizes data from the *ForC* database [Fig. 1; https://github.com/forc-db/ForC; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016, @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
*ForC* amalgamates numerous intermediary data sets [*e.g.*, @luyssaert_co2_2007; @bond-lamberty_global_2010; @cook-patton_mapping_2020] and original studies.
Original publications were referenced to check values and obtain information not contained in intermediary data sets, although this process has not been completed for all records.
The database was developed with goals of understanding how C cycling in forests varies across broad geographic scales and as a function of stand age.
As such, there has been a focus on incorporating data from regrowth forests (*e.g.*, Anderson et al 2006, Martin et al 2013, Bonner et al 2013) and obtaining stand age data when possible [83% of records in v.2.0; @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
Particular attention was given to developing the database for tropical forests [@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016], which represented roughly one-third of records in *ForC* v.2.0* [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
Since publication of ForC v.2.0, we added the following data to ForC: the Global Database of Soil Respiration Database [*SRDB* v.##, `r n_SRDB` records; @bond-lamberty_global_2010], the Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment database [*GROA* v1.0, `r n_GROA` records; @cook-patton_mapping_2020; @anderson-teixeira_forc-dbgroa_2020].
We've also added data from individual publications (detailed list at https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/database_management_records/ForC_data_additions_log.csv), with a particular focus on productivity [@banbury_morgan_global_nodate; e.g., @taylor_temperature_2017], dead wood, and ForestGEO sites [e.g., @lutz_global_2018, @johnson_climate_2018].
We note that there remains a significant amount of relevant data that is not yet included in ForC, particularly biomass data from national forest inventories (*e.g.*,: **REFS**).
The database version used for this analysis has been tagged as a new release on Github (**XX**) and assigned a DOI through Zenodo (DOI: TBD).

To facilitate analyses, we created a simplified version of ForC, *ForC-simplified* (https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/ForC_simplified), which we analyzed here.
In generating *ForC-simplified*, all measurements originally expressed in units of dry organic matter ($OM$) were converted to units of C using the IPCC default of $C = 0.47 * OM$ (IPCC 2006).
Duplicate or otherwise conflicting records were reconciled as described in *APPENDIX S1*, resulting in a total of `r nrow(ForC_simplified)` records (`r round(nrow(ForC_simplified)/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100,digits=1)`% size of total database).
Records were filtered to remove plots that had undergone significant anthropogenic management or major disturbance since the most recent stand initiation event.
Specifically, we removed all plots flagged as managed in ForC-simplified (`r round(n_managed_in_ForC_simplified/nrow(ForC_simplified)*100,digits=1)`%).
This included plots with any record of managements manipulating CO~2~, temperature, hydrology, nutrients, or biota, as well as any plots whose site or plot name contained the terms “plantation”, "planted", “managed”, “irrigated”, or “fertilized”.
Plots flagged as disturbed in ForC-simplified (`r round(n_disturbed_in_ForC_simplified/nrow(ForC_simplified)*100,digits=1)`%) included stands that had undergone any notable anthropogenic thinning or partial harvest.
We retained sites that were grazed or had undergone low severity natural disturbances (<10% mortality) including droughts, major storms, fires, and floods.
We removed all plots for which no stand history information had been retrieved (`r round(n_no_history/nrow(ForC_simplified)*100,digits=1)`%).
In total, this resulted in `r records_eligible_for_inclusion` records (`r round(records_eligible_for_inclusion/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100,digits=1)`% of the records in the database) being eligible for inclusion in the analysis.

We selected 23 annual flux and 11 C stock variables for inclusion in the analysis.
These different flux and stock variables (Table 1) represent different pools (e.g., aboveground biomass, dead wood, ecosystem total) and levels of combination (e.g., total aboveground net primary productivity ($ANPP$) versus the ANPP of individual elements such as foliage, roots, and branches. 
Note that two flux variables, aboveground heterotropic ($R_{het-ag}$) and total ($R_{het}$) respiration, were included for conceptual completeness but had no records in *ForC* (Table 1).
Records for these variables represented `r round(n_focal_variable_records_eligible_for_inclusion/records_eligible_for_inclusion*100,digits=1)`% of the total records eligible for inclusion.
For this analysis, we combined some of ForC’s specific variables (*e.g.*, multiple variables for net primary productivity, such as measurements including or excluding fruit and flower production and herbivory) into more broadly defined variables. 
Specifically, net ecosystem exchange (measured by eddy-covariance; **FLUXNET REF**) and biometric estimates of $NEP$ were combined into the single variable $NEP$ (Table 1).
Furthermore, for $NPP$, $ANPP$, and $ANPP_{litterfall}$, *ForC* variables specifying inclusion of different components were combined.
Throughout ForC, for all measurements drawing from tree census data (*e.g.*, biomass, productivity), the minimum diameter breast height (DBH) threshold for tree census was $\le$ 10cm. 
All records were measured directly or derived from field measurements (as opposed to modeled).

```

For this analysis, we grouped forests into four broad biome types based on climate zones and dominant vegetation type (tropical broadleaf, temperate broadleaf, temperate needleleaf, and boreal needleleaf) and two age classifications (young and mature).
Climate zones (Fig. 1) were defined based on site geographic coordinates according to Köppen-Geiger zones (Rubel and Kottek 2010).
We defined the tropical biome as including all equatorial (A) zones, temperate biomes as including all warm temperate (C) zones and warmer snow climates (Dsa, Dsb, Dwa, Dwb, Dfa, and Dfb), and the boreal biome as including the colder snow climates (Dsc, Dsd, Dwc, Dwd, Dfc, and Dfd).
Any forests in dry (B) and polar (E) Köppen-Geiger zones were excluded from the analysis.
We defined leaf type (broadleaf / needleleaf) was based on descriptions in original publications (prioritized) or values extracted from a global map based on satellite observations [SYNMAP; @jung_exploiting_2006].
For young tropical forests imported from *GROA* but not yet classified by leaf type, we assumed that all were broadleaf, consistent with the rarity of naturally regenerating needleleaf forests in the tropics (**REF**).
We also classified forests as “young” (< 100 years) or “mature” ($\ge$ 100 years or classified as “mature”, “old growth”, “intact”, or “undisturbed” in original publication).
Assigning stands to these groupings required the exclusion of records for which *ForC* lacked geographic coordinates (`r round(n_sites_coord_unk/nrow(ForC_sites)*100, digits=1)`% of sites in full database) or records of stand age (`r round(n_records_age_unk/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100, digits=1)`% of records in full database). 
We also excluded records of stand age = 0 year (`r round(n_records_age_0/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100, digits=1)`% of records in full database).
In total, our analysis retained `r round(n_records/n_focal_variable_records_eligible_for_inclusion*100, digits=1)` of the focal variable records for forests of known age.
Numbers of records by biome and age class are given in Table S1. 

Data were summarized to produce schematics of C cycling across the eight biome by age group combinations identified above.
To obtain the values reported in the C cycle schematics, we first averaged any repeated measurements within a plot.
Values were then averaged across geographically distinct areas, defined as plots clustered within 25 km of one another [*sensu* @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018], weighting by area sampled if available for all records.
This step was taken to avoid pseudo-replication and to combine any records from sites with more than one name in ForC.

We tested whether the C budgets described above "closed"--*i.e.*, whether they were internally consistent.
Specifically, we first defined relationships among variables: for example, $NEP =	GPP - R_{eco}$, $BNPP = BNPP_{coarse} + BNPP_{fine}$, $DW_{tot} = DW_{standing} + DW_{down}$).
**([issue #44](https://github.com/forc-db/ERL-review/issues/44)--but just delete this chunk if not resolved before submission)**
Henceforth, we refer to the variables on the left side of the equation as "aggregate" fluxes or stocks, and those that are summed as "component" fluxes or stocks, noting that the same variable can take both aggregate and component positions in different relationships.
We considered the C budget for a given relationship "closed" when component variables summed to within one standard deviation of the aggregate variable. 

To test for differences across mature forest biomes, we also examined how stand age impacted fluxes and stocks, employing a mixed effects model ['lmer' function in 'lme4' R package version **x.xx**; **REF**] with biome as fixed effect and plot nested within geographic.area as random effects on the intercept.
When Biome had a significant effect, we looked at a Tukey's pairwise comparison to see which biomes were significantly different from one another. 
This analysis was run for variables with records for at least seven distinct geographic areas in more than one biome, excluding any biomes that failed this criteria (Table 1). 

To test for age trends in young (<100yrs) forests, we employed a mixed effects model with biome and log10[stand.age] as fixed effects and plot nested within geographic.area as a random effect on the intercept.
This analysis was run for variables with records for at least three distinct geographic areas in more than one biome, excluding any biomes that failed this criteria (Table 1). 
When the effect of stand age was significant at p $\le$ 0.05 and when each biome had records for stands of at least 10 different ages, a biome $\times$ stand.age interaction was included in the model.

To facilitate the accessibility of our results and data, and to allow for rapid updates as additional data become available, we have automated all database manipulation, analyses, and figure production in R (**version, citation**).

### Data Coverage

Of the `r nrow(ForC_measurements)` records in *ForC* v3.0, `r n_records` met our strict criteria for inclusion in this study (Fig. 1).
These records were distributed across `r n_plots_tot` plots in `r n_areas_tot` distinct geographic areas.
Of the 23 flux and 11 stock variables mapped in these diagrams, *ForC* contained sufficient mature forest data for inclusion in our statistical analyses (*i.e.*, records from $\ge$ 7 distinct geographic areas) for `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Tropical broadleaf MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Tropical broadleaf MATURE"]]` stocks in tropical broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate broadleaf MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate broadleaf MATURE"]]` stocks in temperate broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate conifer MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate conifer MATURE"]]` stocks in temperate conifer forests, and `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Boreal conifer MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Boreal conifer MATURE"]]` stocks in boreal forests.
For regrowth forests (<100 yrs), *ForC* contained sufficient data for inclusion in our statistical analyses (*i.e.*, records from $\ge$ **3** distinct geographic areas) for `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Tropical broadleaf YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Tropical broadleaf YOUNG"]]` stocks in tropical broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate broadleaf YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate broadleaf YOUNG"]]` stocks in temperate broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate conifer YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate conifer YOUNG"]]` stocks in temperate conifer forests, and `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Boreal conifer YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Boreal conifer YOUNG"]]` stocks in boreal forests.

### C cycling in mature forests

Average C cycles for mature tropical broadleaf, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal forests $\ge$ 100 years old and with no known major natural or anthropogenic disturbance are presented in Figures 2-5 (and available in tabular format in the *ForC* release accompanying this publication:  `ForC/numbers_and_facts/ForC_variable_averages_per_Biome.csv`).

For variables with records from $\ge$ 7 distinct geographic areas, these ensemble C budgets were generally consistent.
That is, component variables summed to within one standard deviation of their respective aggregate variables in all but one instance.
In the temperate conifer biome, the average composite measure of root biomass ($B_{root}$) was less than the combined average value of coarse and fine root biomass ($B_{root-coarse}$ and $B_{root-fine}$, respectively).
This lack of closure was driven by very high estimates of $B_{root-coarse}$ from high-biomass forests of the US Pacific Northwest.

There were sufficient data to assess mature forest biome differences for 15 flux variables, and significant differences among biomes were detected for 12 variables (Table 1).
In all of these cases--including C fluxes into, within, and out of the ecosystem--C fluxes were highest in tropical forests, intermediate in temperate (broadleaf or conifer) forests, and lowest in boreal forests (Table 1, Figs. 6, S1-S15).
Differences between tropical and boreal forests were always significant, with temperate forests intermediate and significantly different from one or both.
Fluxes tended to be numerically greater in temperate broadleaf than conifer forests, but the difference was never statistically significant.
This pattern held for the following variables: GPP$, $NPP$, $ANPP$, $ANPP_{stem}$,$ANPP_{branch}$, $ANPP_{foliage}$, $BNPP$, $R_{eco}$, $R_{root}$, $R_{soil}$, and $R_{het-soil}$. 
For two of the variables without significant differences among biomes ($ANPP_{litterfall}$ and $BNPP_{fine}$; Figs. S8 and S11, respectively), the same general trends applied but were not statistically significant. 
Another exception was for $BNPP_{root-coarse}$, where all records came from high-biomass forests in the US Pacific Northwest, resulting in marginally higher values for the temperate conifer biome (Table 1, Fig. S10; differences significant in mixed effects model but not in post-hoc pairwise comparison).  

The most notable exception to the pattern of decreasing flux from tropical to boreal biomes was $NEP$, with no significant differences across biomes but with the largest average in temperate broadleaf forests, followed by tropical, boreal, and temperate conifer forests (Figs. 5,S1).

There were sufficient data to assess mature forest biome differences for nine stock variables, and significant differences among biomes were detected for five variables ($B_{tot}$, $B_{ag}$, $B_{ag-wood}$, $B_{foliage}$, $B_{root-coarse}$; Table 1).
C stocks had less consistent patterns across biomes (Figs. 7, S16-S26).
For $B_{tot}$ and $B_{ag}$, tropical broadleaf forests had the highest biomass and boreal forests the lowest, with temperate broadleaf and needleleaf ($B_{ag}$ only) intermediate.
For three variables that had been disproportionately sampled in the high-biomass forests of the US Pacific Northwest ($B_{ag-wood}$, $B_{foliage}$, and $B_{root-coarse}$), temperate conifer forests had significantly higher stocks than the other biomes, which were not significantly different from one another.

### C cycling in young forests

Average C cycles for forests <100 years old are presented in Figures 8-11.  
Both C stocks and fluxes commonly increased significantly with stand age (Tables 1, S2, Figs. 6-11, S1-S26; detailed below).

*ForC* contained 16 C flux variables with sufficient data for analyses of age trends in young forests (see Methods) (Figs. 6, S1-S15).
Of these, ten increased significantly with age: $NEP$, $GPP$, $ANPP$, $ANPP_{woody}$, $ANPP_{foliage}$, $ANPP_{litterfal}$, $BNPP$, $BNPP_{fine}$, $R_{eco}$, and $R_{root}$.
The remaining six--$NPP$, $ANPP_{stem}$, $ANPP_{branch}$, $BNPP_{coarse}$, $R_{soil-het}$, and $R_{soil-het}$-–displayed no significant relationship to stand age.

Differences in C fluxes across biomes typically paralleled those observed for mature forests, with C cycling generally most rapid in the tropics and slowest in boreal forests.  
The single exception was $ANPP_{stem}$, for which temperate broadleaf and conifer forests had similar flux rates than tropical forests.
Notably, and in contrast to the lack of biome differences in $NEP$ for mature forests (Fig. 6), the tendency for temperate forests to have greater fluxes than boreal forests held for $NEP$ in regrowth forests (tropical forests excluded because of insufficient data).

In terms of C stocks, ten variables (all but standing deadwood, $DW_{standing}$) had sufficient data to test for age trends (Table 1, Figs. 7, S16-26).
All of these increased significantly with $log10[stand.age]$.
There were sufficient data to model age x biome interactions were also significant for all ten of these C stock variables (Table S2).

## Discussion
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# The Discussion section highlights the general conclusions, emphasizes novel findings, puts them in context and identifies issues and inferences for future work or policy considerations.
```

*ForC* v3.0 provided unprecedented coverage of most major variables, yielding an internally consistent picture of C cycling in the world's major forest biomes.
Carbon cycling rates generally increased from boreal to tropical regions and with stand age.
Specifically, the major C fluxes were highest in tropical forests, intermediate in temperate (broadleaf or conifer) forests, and lowest in boreal forests -- a pattern that generally held for regrowth as well as mature forests (Figs. 6-7).
In contrast to C fluxes, there was little directional variation in mature forest C stocks across biomes (Figs. 2-5, 7).
The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with stand age (Figs. 6-11).
Together, these results indicate that, moving from cold to tropical climates and from young to old stands, there is a general acceleration of C cycling, whereas C stocks and $NEP$ of mature forests are correlated with a different set of factors.

### C variable coverage and budget closure

The large number of C cycle variables covered by ForC, and the general consistency between them, provide confidence that our overall reported means provide accurate and useful baselines for analysis -- with the caveats that they are unlikely to be accurate representations of C cycling for any particular forest, and that these sample means almost certainly do not represent true biome means (particularly for temperate conifer forests where high-biomass stands are over-represented in *ForC*).

There are of course notable holes in the ForC variable coverage (Fig. 1), that limit the scope of our inferences here. 
Notably, *ForC* currently has sparse--if any--coverage of fluxes to herbivores and higher consumers, along with the woody mortality ($M_{woody}$) and dead wood stocks (Tables 1, Figs. S23-S25). 
Geographically, all variables are poorly covered in Africa and Siberia, a common problem in the carbon-cycle community [@xu_contribution_2016; @schimel_effect_2015]. 
*ForC* does not include soil carbon, which is covered by other efforts [e.g., @kochy_global_2015]. 
*ForC* is not intended to replace databases that are specialized for particular parts of the C cycle analyses, e.g., aboveground biomass (**REFS**), land-atmosphere fluxes [@baldocchi_fluxnet_2001], soil respiration [@jian_reconstructed_2020], or the human footprint in global forests [@magnani_human_2007].

In this analysis, the C cycle budgets for mature forests (Figs. 2-5) generally “close”–-that is, the sums of component variables do not differ from the larger fluxes by more than one standard deviation. 
On the one hand, this reflects the general fact that ecosystem-scale measurements tend to close the C budget more easily and consistently than, for example, for energy balance [@stoy_data-driven_2013]. 
On the other, however, *ForC* derives data from multiple heterogeneous sources, and standard deviations within each biome are high; as a result, the standard for C closure is relatively loose [*c.f.* @houghton_terrestrial_2020]. 
Nonetheless, the lack of closure, in the one instance where it occurs, is probably more reflective of differences in the representation of forest types (*i.e.*, disproportionate representation of US Pacific NW for  $B_{root-coarse}$ relative to  $B_{root}$; Fig. 4) than of methodological accuracy. 
The overall high degree of closure implies that *ForC* gives a consistent picture of C cycling within biomes. 
This is an important and useful test, because it allows for consistency checks within the C cycle, for example leveraging separate and independently-measured fluxes to constrain errors in another [@phillips_value_2017; @williams_impacts_2014; @harmon_heterotrophic_2011], or producing internally consistent global data products [@wang_golum-cnp_2018]. 

### C cycling across biomes

Our analysis reveals a general deceleration of carbon cycling from the tropics to boreal regions.
For mature forests, this is consistent with a large body of previous work demonstrating that C fluxes generally decline with latitude (or increase with temperature) on a global scale [e.g., @luyssaert_co_2007;  @gillman_latitude_2015; @li_mapping_2019; @banbury_morgan_global_nodate].
The consistency with which this occurs across numerous fluxes is not surprising, but has never been simultaneously assessed across such a large number of variables [but see @banbury_morgan_global_nodate for nine autotrophic fluxes].
Thus, our analysis reveals that carbon cycling is most rapid in the tropics and slowest in boreal regions, including C fluxes into ($GPP$), within (e.g., $NPP$ and its components), and out of (e.g., $R_{soil}$, $R_{eco}$) the ecosystem.

The notable exception to the pattern of fluxes decreasing from tropical to boreal regions is $NEP$ (Fig. 6f), which showed no significant differences across biomes.
Unlike the other C flux variables, $NEP$ does not represent the rapidity with which C cycles through the ecosystem, but is the balance between C sequestration ($GPP$) and respiratory losses ($R_{eco}$) and represents net CO~2~ sequestration (or release) by the ecosystem.
$NEP$ tends to be relatively small in mature forest stands [@luyssaert_old-growth_2008, **MORE REFS?**; discussed further below], which accumulate carbon slowly relative to younger stands [@luyssaert_old-growth_2008; **REFS**), if at all (**REFS**).
It is therefore unsurprising that there are no pronounced differences across biomes, suggesting that variation in $NEP$ of mature forests is controlled less by climate and more by other factors including moderate disturbances (**REFS**) or disequilibrium of $R_{soil}$ relative to C inputs [e.g., in peatlands where anoxic conditions inhibit decomposition; **REFS**].

In contrast to the patterns observed for $NEP$ in mature stands, $NEP$ of stands between 20 and 100 years of age varied across biomes, being lowest in boreal forests, intermediate in temperate broadleaf forests, and highest in temperate conifer forests (with insufficient data to assess tropical forests; Figs. 6f, S1).
This is consistent with findings that live biomass accumulation rates (*e.g.*, $\Delta B_{ag}$ or $\Delta B_{tot}$) during early secondary succession decrease with latitude [@anderson_temperature-dependence_2006; @cook-patton_mapping_2020; Figs. 7a, S16-S22]. 
Note, though, that $NEP$ includes not only $\Delta B_{tot}$, but also changes in $DW_{tot}$, $OL$, and soil carbon, and biome differences in the accumulation rates of these variables have not been detected, in part because these variables do not consistently increase with stand age [@cook-patton_mapping_2020; Figs. 7, S23-S26; see discussion below].

For regrowth forests, little is known about cross-biome differences in carbon fluxes, and we are not aware of any previous large-scale comparisons of C fluxes that have been limited to regrowth forests [although they're commonly mixed in with mature forests; e.g., **REFS**]. 
Thus, this analysis was the first to examine flux trends in regrowth forests across biomes.
The observed tendency for young forest fluxes to decrease from tropical to boreal regions paralleled patterns in mature forests (Figs. 6, S1-S15), suggesting that regrowth forests follow latitudinal trends in carbon cycling similar to those of mature forests [e.g., @banbury_morgan_global_nodate].

In contrast to C fluxes and biomass accumulation rates in regrowth forests, stocks showed less systematic variation across biomes.
This is consistent with others studies showing that variation in forest biomass across broad climatic gradients is modest and constrained more by moisture than temperature [@stegen_variation_2011].
Yet, differences across biomes did exist.
@hu_mapping_2016, using spaceborne lidar, showed a decline in aboveground biomass (all forests, including secondary) with latitude in the N hemisphere, but values exceeding tropical forests in coastal climates of both the southern and northern hemisphere. 
Highest biomass forests are found in temperate oceanic climates (REF- , something in GEB, some global forest C map) [@keith_re-evaluation_2009].
Lack of synthesis comparing deadwood and organic layer across biomes, but see @cook-patton_mapping_2020 for age trends.

Thus, biome differences should be interpreted more as driven more by geographic distribution of sampling than by true differences.



### Age trends in C cycling  

*(Just some rough notes at this point)*

A relative dearth of data on C cycling in secondary forests, particularly in the tropics (Anderson-Teixeira et al 2016), is problematic in that almost 2/3 of the world’s forests were secondary as of 2010 (FAO 2010), implying an under-filled need to characterize age-related trends in forest C cycling.

Moreover, as disturbances increase [@andela_human-driven_2017; @mcdowell_pervasive_2020], understanding the carbon dynamics of regrowth forests will be increasingly important.

It's also important to understand secondary forest C sequestration to reduce uncertainty regarding the potential for carbon uptake by regrowth forests [@kruase_large_2018; @cook-patton_mapping_2020].

(discuss NEP well, including)
NEP increases with log(age) to 100 --> strongest C sinks are established secondary forests. (But presumably this exact number is an artifact; don’t over-emphasize.)

Our findings are largely consistent with, but built from a far larger dataset than, those of Pregitzer and Euskirchen (2004 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00866.x), who found that NPP and NEP to be higher in intermediate-aged forests than older forests, and emphasize the importance of forest age at the biome scale. 
Quickly-changing and age-dependent fluxes were also found in a number of previous syntheses (Amiro et al. 2010 10.1029/2010JG001390, Magnani et al. 2007 10.1038/nature05847). 

In contrast to most fluxes, $NEP$ is highest at intermediate ages

### Relevance for climate change prediction and mitigation

The future of forest C cycling [@song_meta-analysis_2019] will shape trends in atmospheric CO~2~ and the course of climate change.
For a human society seeking to understand and mitigate climate change, the data contained in *ForC* and summarized here can help to meet two major challenges.

First, improved representation of forest C cycling in models is essential to improving predictions of the future course of climate change.
To ensure that models are giving the right answers for the right reasons, it is important to benchmark against multiple components of the C cycle that are internally consistent with each other.
By making tens of thousands of records readily available in standardized format, *ForC* makes it feasible for the modeling community to draw upon these data to benchmark models.
Integration of *ForC* with models is a goal (Fer et al., in revision).

Second, *ForC* can serve as a pipeline through which forest science can inform forest-based climate change mitigation efforts.
Such efforts will be most effective when informed by the best available data, yet it is not feasible for the individuals and organizations designing such efforts to sort through literature, often behind paywalls, with data reported in varying units, terminology, etc.
One goal for *ForC* is to serve as a pipeline through which information can flow efficiently from forest researchers to decision-makers working to implement forest conservation strategies at global, national, or landscape scales.
This is already happening!
*ForC* has already contributed to updating the IPCC guidelines for carbon accounting in forests [IPCC 2019; @requena_suarez_estimating_2019; Rozendaal et al in prep], mapping C accumulation potential from natural forest regrowth globally [@cook-patton_mapping_2020], and informing ecosystem conservation priorities [@goldstein_protecting_2020].

***ForC* can complement remote sensing to provide a comprehensive picture of global forest C cycling.** (*here, discuss what is well-covered by remote sesnsing, where ForC is useful for calibrating remote sensing, and what ForC can get that remote sensing can't.*)
AGB is the largest stock, and most of the emphasis is on this variable.
Remote sensing, with calibration based on high-quality ground-based data [@schepaschenko_forest_2019; @chave_ground_2019], is the best approach for mapping forest carbon (REFS).
However, it is limited in that it is not associated with stand age and disturbance history, except in recent decades when satellite data can be used to detect forest loss, gain, and some of their dominant drivers [@hansen_high-resolution_2013; @song_global_2018; @curtis_classifying_2018].
*ForC*  is therefore valuable in defining age-based trajectories in biomass, as in @cook-patton_mapping_2020.

*Remote sensing measurements are increasingly useful for global- or regional-scale estimates of forest $GPP$ [@bagdley_terrestrial_2019; @li_mapping_2019], aboveground biomass ($B_{ag}$) (REFS), woody mortality (*i.e.*, $B_{ag}$ losses to mortality $M_{woody}$) [@clark_quantifying_2004; @leitold_nino_2018], and to some extent net ecosystem exchange ($NEP$) (REFS).*
Other variables, in particular respiration fluxes, cannot be remotely sensed (@bond-lamberty_estimating_2016), and efforts such as the Global Carbon Project (**le quere REF**) and NASA CMS (**citation: https://carbon.nasa.gov/pdfs/CMS_Phase-1_Report_Final_optimized.pdf but maybe better to cite open literature, one of the papers listed at https://cmsflux.jpl.nasa.gov/get-data/publication-data-sets**) typically compute them as residuals only. (**Ben, it woudl be particularly helpful if you could flesh this out some more.**)

In terms of C stocks, there is a paucity of data on dead wood and organic layer (Pan et al. ?).
These can be significant. (**Note that we've given a lot of emphasis to dead wood (work by Abby), and as a result this work really advances knowledge of dead wood. We'll want to highlight that here.**)
*(give some stats/ cite figures)*.

**Move to data availability statement, or methods?**:
We recommend that use of *ForC* data go to the original database, as opposed to using "off-the-shelf" values from this publication.
This is because
(1) *ForC* is constantly being updated,
(2) analyses should be designed to match the application,
(3) age equations presented here all fit a single functional form that is not necessarily the best possible for all the variables.

As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests will be critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation.
The C data in ForC, as summarized here, will be valuable to these efforts.

# All references should be presented in alphabetical order and should also be bundled in ways that will help the reader to find those that are germane to each of the themes, topics or issues that the authors have used to organize the review. Such a matrix will be included as supplementary material. ERL has no standardized format for subdividing references by cross-cutting themes, but guidance from editors will be helpful to authors.
