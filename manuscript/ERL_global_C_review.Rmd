## Summary

*Background.* Earth’s climate is closely linked to forests, which strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and climate by their impact on the global carbon (C) cycle. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO~2~ accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale data on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. 

*Methods/Design.* Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world’s forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use `r n_records` *ForC* records from `r n_areas_tot` geographic locations representing `r nrow(T1)` C cycle variables to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types (tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and taiga), including estimates for both mature and regrowth (age <100 years) forests. For regrowth forests, we quantify age trends for all variables with sufficient data.

*Review Results/ Synthesis.*  *ForC v3.0* yielded a comprehensive picture of C cycling in the world's major forest biomes. The rate of C cycling generally increased from boreal to tropical regions in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with stand age. Importantly, there was generally good closure of C budgets, *i.e.,* internal consistency in the *ForC* data.

*Discussion.* As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This synthetic and internally consistent global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages will help to advance these efforts. 

*Key words*: forest ecosystems; carbon cycle; stand age; productivity; respiration; biomass; global

## Background
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# The Background section needs to present the rationale for why a systematic review of this topic is needed along with a history of what has been done to date and an expectation of what new will emerge from the review, especially if quantitative meta-analyses of studies are being considered.
```

Forest ecosystems are shaping the course of climate change through their influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO~2~; @bonan_forests_2008; @friedlingstein_global_2019; @ipcc_global_2018].
Despite the centrality of forest C cycling in regulating atmospheric CO~2~, important uncertainties in climate models [@friedlingstein_climatecarbon_2006; @krause_large_2018; @bonan_model_2019; @di_vittorio_initial_2020] and CO~2~ accounting frameworks [@pan_large_2011] can be traced to lack of accessible, comprehensive data on how C cycling varies across forest types and in relation to stand history.
These require large-scale databases with global coverage, which runs contrary to the nature in which forest C stocks and fluxes are measured and published.
While remote sensing measurements are increasingly useful for global- or regional-scale estimates of a few critical variables [e.g., aboveground biomass: @hu_mapping_2016; @spawn_harmonized_2020; gross primary productivity, $GPP$: @li_mapping_2019; @saatchi_benchmark_2011], measurement and validation of most forest C stocks and fluxes require intensive on-the-ground data collection.

A robust understanding of forest impacts on global C cycling is essential. 
Annual gross CO~2~ sequestration in forests (gross primary productivity, $GPP$) is estimated at >69 Gt C yr^-1^ [@badgley_terrestrial_2019], or >7 times average annual fossil fuel emissions from 2009-2018 [9.5 $\pm$ 0.5 Gt C yr^-1^; @friedlingstein_global_2019].
Most of this enormous C sequestration is counterbalanced by CO~2~ releases to the atmosphere through ecosystem respiration ($R_{eco}$) or fire, with forests globally dominant as sources of both soil respiration [@warner_spatial_2019] and fire emissions [@van_der_werf_global_2017].
In recent years, the remaining CO~2~ sink averaged 3.2 $\pm$ 0.6 GtC yr^-1^ from 2009-2018, offsetting 29% of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions [@friedlingstein_global_2019].
Yet, this sink is reduced by deforestation, estimated at ~1 Gt C yr^-1^ in recent decades [@pan_large_2011; @tubiello_carbon_2020], reducing the net forest sink to ~1.1-2.2 Gt C yr^-1^ across Earth's forests [@friedlingstein_global_2019].

The future of the current forest C sink is dependent both upon forest responses to climate change itself and human land use decisions, which will feedback and strongly influence the course of climate change. 
Regrowing forests in particular will play an important role [@pugh_role_2019], as almost two-thirds of the world’s forests were secondary as of 2010 [@fao_global_2010].
As anthropogenic and climate-driven disturbances impact an growing proportion of Earth's forests [@andela_human-driven_2017; @mcdowell_pervasive_2020], understanding the carbon dynamics of regrowth forests is increasingly important [@andersonteixeira_altered_2013].
Although age trends in aboveground biomass have been relatively well-studied and synthesized globally [@cook-patton_mapping_2020], a relative dearth of data and synthesis on other C stocks and fluxes in secondary forests points to an under-filled need to characterize age-related trends in forest C cycling.
Such understanding is particularly critical for reducing uncertainty regarding the potential for carbon uptake and climate change mitigation by regrowth forests [@krause_large_2018; @cook-patton_mapping_2020].
Understanding, modeling, and managing forest-atmosphere CO~2~ exchange is thus central to efforts to mitigate climate change [@grassi_key_2017; @griscom_natural_2017; @cavaleri_urgent_2015].

Despite the importance of forests, comprehensive global studies have historically been limited by the scattered and more local nature of research studies. 
Primary research articles typically cover only a small numbers of sites at a time.
The rare exceptions that span regions or continents with rare exceptions spanning regions or continents are typically coordinated through research networks such as ForestGEO [@anderson-teixeira_ctfs-forestgeo_2015; e.g., @lutz_global_2018], NEON [@schimel_neon_2007], or FLUXNET [@baldocchi_fluxnet_2001; e.g., @novick_ameriflux_2018].
The result of decades of research on forest C cycling is that tens of thousands of records have been distributed across literally thousands of scientific articles --often behind paywalls-- along with variation in data formats, units, measurement methods, *etc.*
In this format, the data are effectively inaccessible for many global-scale analyses, including those attempting to benchmark model performance with global data (Clark et al 2017, Luo et al 2012), quantify the the role of forests in the global C cycle [*e.g.*, @pan_large_2011], or use book-keeping methods to quantify actual or scenario-based exchanges of CO~2~ between forests and the atmosphere [@griscom_natural_2017; @houghton_terrestrial_2020].

To address the need for global-scale analyses of forest C cycling, we recently developed *ForC* [@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016; @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
*ForC* contains published estimates of forest ecosystem C stocks and annual fluxes (>50 variables), with the different variables capturing the unique ecosystem pools (e.g., woody, foliage, and root biomass; dead wood) and flux types (e.g, gross and net primary productivity; soil, root, and ecosystem respiration). 
These data are ground-based measurements, and *ForC* contains associated data required for interpretation (*e.g.*, stand history, measurement methods).
Data have been amalgamated from original peer-reviewed publications, either directly or via intermediary data compilations.
Since the its most recent publication [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018], *ForC* has grown to include two additional large databases: the Global Soil Respiration Database [SRDB; @bond-lamberty_global_2010] and the Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment database [GROA; @cook-patton_mapping_2020] that also synthesized published forest C data.
Following these additions, *ForC* currently contains `r nrow(ForC_measurements)` records from `r nrow(ForC_plots)` plots and `r n_areas` distinct geographic areas representing all forested biogeographic and climate zones.
This represents an `r round((nrow(ForC_measurements) - 17367)/17367*100, digits=0)`% increase in records from the prior publication [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].


Here, we provide a robust and comprehensive analysis of carbon cycling from a stand to global level, and by biome and stand age, using the largest global compilation of forest carbon data, which is available in our open source Global Carbon Forest database (*ForC*; Fig. `r figure_map`).
Our primary goal is to provide a data-driven summary of our current state of knowledge on broad trends in forest C cycling. 
Specifically, we address three broad questions:

~~1. How thoroughly can we represent C budgets for each of the world's major forest biomes (*i.e.*, tropical, temperate broadleaf and deciduous, boreal) based on the current *ForC* data?~~

2. How do C cycling vary across the world's major forest biomes?

3. How does C cycling vary with stand age (in interaction with biome)?

While researchers have been addressing components of these questions for more than half a century [@odum_strategy_1969; @luyssaert_co2_2007; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016; @cook-patton_mapping_2020; @banbury_morgan_global_nodate], our analysis represents by far the most comprehensive analysis of C cycling in global forests, and will serve as a foundation for improved understanding of global forest C cycling and highlight where key sources of uncertainty still reside.

## Methods/ Design
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# The Methods/Design section needs to describe how articles in the reviews were identified and what criteria were used for justifying inclusion in the review. While traditional reviews relying on past experience and expert knowledge are acceptable, editors should encourage reviews that are set up as so-called ‘systematic reviews’ (see the Cochrane Review procedure which initiated the process in the medical and health science: http://community.cochrane.org/ about-us/evidence-based-health-care).
```


This review synthesizes data from the *ForC* database [Fig. `r figure_map`; https://github.com/forc-db/ForC; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016; @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
*ForC* amalgamates numerous intermediary data sets [*e.g.*, @luyssaert_co2_2007; @bond-lamberty_global_2010; @cook-patton_mapping_2020] and original studies.
Original publications were referenced to check values and obtain information not contained in intermediary data sets, although this process has not been completed for all records.
The database was developed with goals of understanding how C cycling in forests varies across broad geographic scales and as a function of stand age.
As such, there has been a focus on incorporating data from regrowth forests (*e.g.*, Anderson et al 2006, Martin et al 2013, Bonner et al 2013) and obtaining stand age data when possible [83% of records in v.2.0; @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
Particular attention was given to developing the database for tropical forests [@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016], which represented roughly one-third of records in *ForC* v2.0 [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018].
Since publication of ForC v2.0, we added the following data to ForC: the Global Database of Soil Respiration Database [*SRDB* v4, `r n_SRDB` records; @bond-lamberty_global_2010], the Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment database [*GROA* v1.0, `r n_GROA` records; @cook-patton_mapping_2020; @anderson-teixeira_forc-dbgroa_2020].
We have also added data from individual publications, with a particular focus on productivity [e.g., @taylor_temperature_2017], dead wood, and ForestGEO sites [e.g., @lutz_global_2018, @johnson_climate_2018].
The database version used for this analysis has been tagged as a new release on Github (v3.0) and assigned a DOI through Zenodo (DOI: TBD).

To facilitate analyses, we created a simplified version of ForC, *ForC-simplified* (https://github.com/forc-db/ForC/blob/master/ForC_simplified), which we analyzed here.
In generating *ForC-simplified*, all measurements originally expressed in units of dry organic matter ($OM$) were converted to units of C using the IPCC default of $C = 0.47 * OM$ [@ipcc_global_2018].
Duplicate or otherwise conflicting records were reconciled as described in Appendix S1, resulting in a total of `r ForC_simplified_duplicates_removed` records (`r round(ForC_simplified_duplicates_removed/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100,digits=1)`% size of total database).
Records were filtered to remove plots that had undergone significant anthropogenic management or major disturbance since the most recent stand initiation event.
Specifically, we removed all plots flagged as managed in ForC-simplified (`r round(n_managed_in_ForC_simplified/ForC_simplified_duplicates_removed*100,digits=1)`%).
This included plots with any record of managements manipulating CO~2~, temperature, hydrology, nutrients, or biota, as well as any plots whose site or plot name contained the terms “plantation”, "planted", “managed”, “irrigated”, or “fertilized”.
Plots flagged as disturbed in ForC-simplified (`r round(n_disturbed_in_ForC_simplified/ForC_simplified_duplicates_removed*100,digits=1)`%) included stands that had undergone any notable anthropogenic thinning or partial harvest.
We retained sites that were grazed or had undergone low severity natural disturbances (<10% mortality) including droughts, major storms, fires, and floods.
We removed all plots for which no stand history information had been retrieved (`r round(n_no_history/ForC_simplified_duplicates_removed*100,digits=1)`%).
In total, this resulted in `r records_eligible_for_inclusion` records (`r round(records_eligible_for_inclusion/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100,digits=1)`% of the records in the database) being eligible for inclusion in the analysis.

We selected 23 annual flux and 11 C stock variables for inclusion in the analysis (Table 1).
These different flux and stock variables represent different pools (e.g., aboveground biomass, root biomass, dead wood) and levels of combination (e.g., total net primary productivity, $NPP$, versus the individual elements of $NPP$ such as foliage, roots, and branches). 
Note that two flux variables, aboveground heterotropic ($R_{het-ag}$) and total ($R_{het}$) respiration, were included for conceptual completeness but had no records in *ForC* (Table 1).
Records for our focal variables represented `r round(n_focal_variable_records_eligible_for_inclusion/records_eligible_for_inclusion*100,digits=1)`% of the total records eligible for inclusion.
For this analysis, we combined some of ForC’s specific variables into more broadly defined variables. 
Specifically, net ecosystem exchange [measured by eddy-covariance; @baldocchi_fluxnet_2001] and biometric estimates of $NEP$ were combined into the single variable $NEP$ (Table 1).
Furthermore, for $NPP$, aboveground $NPP$ ($ANPP$), and the litterfall component of $ANPP$ ($ANPP_{litterfall}$), *ForC* variables specifying inclusion of different components were combined (*e.g.*, measurements including or excluding fruit and flower production and herbivory).
Throughout ForC, for all measurements drawing from tree census data (*e.g.*, biomass, productivity), the minimum diameter breast height (DBH) threshold for tree census was $\le$ 10cm. 
All records were measured directly or derived from field measurements (as opposed to modeled).

```

We grouped forests into four broad biome types based on climate zones and dominant vegetation type (tropical broadleaf, temperate broadleaf, temperate needleleaf, and boreal needleleaf) and two age classifications (young and mature).
Climate zones (Fig. `r figure_map`) were defined based on site geographic coordinates according to Köppen-Geiger zones (Rubel and Kottek 2010).
We defined the tropical biome as including all equatorial (A) zones, temperate biomes as including all warm temperate (C) zones and warmer snow climates (Dsa, Dsb, Dwa, Dwb, Dfa, and Dfb), and the boreal biome as including the colder snow climates (Dsc, Dsd, Dwc, Dwd, Dfc, and Dfd).
Any forests in dry (B) and polar (E) Köppen-Geiger zones were excluded from the analysis.
We defined leaf type (broadleaf / needleleaf) was based on descriptions in original publications (prioritized) or values extracted from a global map based on satellite observations [SYNMAP; @jung_exploiting_2006].
For young tropical forests imported from *GROA* but not yet classified by leaf type, we assumed that all were broadleaf, consistent with the rarity of naturally regenerating needleleaf forests in the tropics.
We also classified forests as “young” (< 100 years) or “mature” ($\ge$ 100 years or classified as “mature”, “old growth”, “intact”, or “undisturbed” in original publication).
Assigning stands to these groupings required the exclusion of records for which *ForC* lacked geographic coordinates (`r round(n_sites_coord_unk/nrow(ForC_sites)*100, digits=1)`% of sites in full database) or records of stand age (`r round(n_records_age_unk/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100, digits=1)`% of records in full database). 
We also excluded records of stand age = 0 year (`r round(n_records_age_0/nrow(ForC_measurements)*100, digits=1)`% of records in full database).
In total, our analysis retained `r round(n_records/n_focal_variable_records_eligible_for_inclusion*100, digits=1)` of the focal variable records for forests of known age.
Numbers of records by biome and age class are given in Table S1. 

Data were summarized to produce schematics of C cycling across the eight biome by age group combinations identified above.
To obtain the values reported in the C cycle schematics, we first averaged any repeated measurements within a plot.
Values were then averaged across geographically distinct areas, defined as plots clustered within 25 km of one another [*sensu* @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018], weighting by area sampled if available for all records.
This step was taken to avoid pseudo-replication.

We tested whether the C budgets described above "closed"--*i.e.*, whether they were internally consistent.
Specifically, we first defined relationships among variables: for example, $NEP =	GPP - R_{eco}$, $BNPP = BNPP_{coarse} + BNPP_{fine}$, $DW_{tot} = DW_{standing} + DW_{down}$).
Henceforth, we refer to the variables on the left side of the equation as "aggregate" fluxes or stocks, and those that are summed as "component" fluxes or stocks, noting that the same variable can take both aggregate and component positions in different relationships.
We considered the C budget for a given relationship "closed" when component variables summed to within one standard deviation of the aggregate variable. 

To test for differences across mature forest biomes, we also examined how stand age impacted fluxes and stocks, employing a mixed effects model ['lmer' function in 'lme4' R package; @bates_fitting_2015] with biome as fixed effect and plot nested within geographic.area as random effects on the intercept.
When Biome had a significant effect, we looked at a Tukey's pairwise comparison to see which biomes were significantly different from one another. 
This analysis was run for variables with records for at least seven distinct geographic areas in more than one biome, excluding any biomes that failed this criteria (Table 1). 

To test for age trends in young (<100yrs) forests, we employed a mixed effects model with biome and log10[stand.age] as fixed effects and plot nested within geographic.area as a random effect on the intercept.
This analysis was run for variables with records for at least three distinct geographic areas in more than one biome, excluding any biomes that failed this criteria (Table 1). 
When the effect of stand age was significant at p $\le$ 0.05 and when each biome had records for stands of at least 10 different ages, a biome $\times$ stand.age interaction was included in the model.

To facilitate the accessibility of our results and data, and to allow for rapid updates as additional data become available, we have automated all database manipulation, analyses, and figure production in R [@r_core_team_r_2020].

### Data Coverage

Of the `r nrow(ForC_measurements)` records in *ForC* v3.0, `r n_records` met our strict criteria for inclusion in this study (Fig. `r figure_map`).
These records were distributed across `r n_plots_tot` plots in `r n_areas_tot` distinct geographic areas.
Of the 23 flux and 11 stock variables mapped in these diagrams, *ForC* contained sufficient mature forest data for inclusion in our statistical analyses (*i.e.*, records from $\ge$ 7 distinct geographic areas) for `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Tropical broadleaf MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Tropical broadleaf MATURE"]]` stocks in tropical broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate broadleaf MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate broadleaf MATURE"]]` stocks in temperate broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate conifer MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Temperate conifer MATURE"]]` stocks in temperate conifer forests, and `r n_fluxes_with_ge7_areas[["Boreal conifer MATURE"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge7_areas[["Boreal conifer MATURE"]]` stocks in boreal forests.
For regrowth forests (<100 yrs), *ForC* contained sufficient data for inclusion in our statistical analyses (*i.e.*, records from $\ge$ 3 distinct geographic areas) for `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Tropical broadleaf YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Tropical broadleaf YOUNG"]]` stocks in tropical broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate broadleaf YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate broadleaf YOUNG"]]` stocks in temperate broadleaf forests, `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate conifer YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Temperate conifer YOUNG"]]` stocks in temperate conifer forests, and `r n_fluxes_with_ge3_areas[["Boreal conifer YOUNG"]]` fluxes and `r n_stocks_with_ge3_areas[["Boreal conifer YOUNG"]]` stocks in boreal forests.

### C cycling in mature forests

Average C cycles for mature tropical broadleaf, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal forests $\ge$ 100 years old and with no known major natural or anthropogenic disturbance are presented in Figures 2-5 (and available in tabular format in the *ForC* release accompanying this publication:  `ForC/numbers_and_facts/ForC_variable_averages_per_Biome.csv`).

For variables with records from $\ge$ 7 distinct geographic areas, these ensemble C budgets were generally consistent.
That is, component variables summed to within one standard deviation of their respective aggregate variables in all but one instance.
In the temperate conifer biome, the average composite measure of root biomass ($B_{root}$) was less than the combined average value of coarse and fine root biomass ($B_{root-coarse}$ and $B_{root-fine}$, respectively).
This lack of closure was driven by very high estimates of $B_{root-coarse}$ from high-biomass forests of the US Pacific Northwest.

There were sufficient data to assess mature forest biome differences for 15 flux variables, and significant differences among biomes were detected for 12 variables (Table 1).
In all of these cases--including C fluxes into, within, and out of the ecosystem--C fluxes were highest in tropical forests, intermediate in temperate (broadleaf or conifer) forests, and lowest in boreal forests (Table 1, Figs. 6, S1-S15).
Differences between tropical and boreal forests were always significant, with temperate forests intermediate and significantly different from one or both.
Fluxes tended to be numerically greater in temperate broadleaf than conifer forests, but the difference was never statistically significant.
This pattern held for the following variables: $GPP$, $NPP$, $ANPP$, $ANPP_{stem}$,$ANPP_{branch}$, $ANPP_{foliage}$, $BNPP$, $R_{eco}$, $R_{root}$, $R_{soil}$, and $R_{het-soil}$. 
For two of the variables without significant differences among biomes ($ANPP_{litterfall}$ and $BNPP_{fine}$; Figs. S8 and S11, respectively), the same general trends applied but were not statistically significant. 
Another exception was for $BNPP_{root-coarse}$, where all records came from high-biomass forests in the US Pacific Northwest, resulting in marginally higher values for the temperate conifer biome (Table 1, Fig. S10; differences significant in mixed effects model but not in post-hoc pairwise comparison).  

The most notable exception to the pattern of decreasing flux from tropical to boreal biomes was $NEP$, with no significant differences across biomes but with the largest average in temperate broadleaf forests, followed by tropical, boreal, and temperate conifer forests (Figs. 5,S1).

There were sufficient data to assess mature forest biome differences for nine stock variables, and significant differences among biomes were detected for five variables ($B_{tot}$, $B_{ag}$, $B_{ag-wood}$, $B_{foliage}$, $B_{root-coarse}$; Table 1).
C stocks had less consistent patterns across biomes (Figs. 7, S16-S26).
For $B_{tot}$ and $B_{ag}$, tropical broadleaf forests had the highest biomass and boreal forests the lowest, with temperate broadleaf and needleleaf ($B_{ag}$ only) intermediate.
For three variables that had been disproportionately sampled in the high-biomass forests of the US Pacific Northwest ($B_{ag-wood}$, $B_{foliage}$, and $B_{root-coarse}$), temperate conifer forests had significantly higher stocks than the other biomes, which were not significantly different from one another.

### C cycling in young forests

Average C cycles for forests <100 years old are presented in Figures 8-11.
Both C stocks and fluxes commonly increased significantly with stand age (Tables 1, S2, Figs. 6-11, S1-S26; detailed below).

*ForC* contained 16 C flux variables with sufficient data for analyses of age trends in young forests (see Methods) (Figs. 6, S1-S15).
Of these, ten increased significantly with age: $NEP$, $GPP$, $ANPP$, $ANPP_{woody}$, $ANPP_{foliage}$, $ANPP_{litterfal}$, $BNPP$, $BNPP_{fine}$, $R_{eco}$, and $R_{root}$.
The remaining six--$NPP$, $ANPP_{stem}$, $ANPP_{branch}$, $BNPP_{coarse}$, $R_{soil-het}$, and $R_{soil-het}$-–displayed no significant relationship to stand age.

Differences in C fluxes across biomes typically paralleled those observed for mature forests, with C cycling generally most rapid in the tropics and slowest in boreal forests.
The single exception was $ANPP_{stem}$, for which temperate broadleaf and conifer forests had similar flux rates than tropical forests.
Notably, and in contrast to the lack of biome differences in $NEP$ for mature forests (Fig. 6), the tendency for temperate forests to have greater fluxes than boreal forests held for $NEP$ in regrowth forests (tropical forests excluded because of insufficient data).

In terms of C stocks, ten variables (all but standing deadwood, $DW_{standing}$) had sufficient data to test for age trends (Table 1, Figs. 7, S16-26).
All of these displayed a significant overall increase with with $log10[stand.age]$.
There were sufficient data to model age $\times$ biome interactions were also significant for all ten of these C stock variables (Table S2), with living C stocks tending to accumulate more rapidly during the early stages of forest regrowth in tropical forests (Figs. 7, S16-S22).
In the case of two non-living C stocks ($DW_{down}$ and $OL$), age $\times$ biome interactions were such that 
Specifically, $DW_{down}$ declined with age in temperate and boreal forests, compared to an increase with age in tropical forests (Figs. 7, S25).
Similarly, $OL$ declined slightly with age in temperate broadleaf forests, contrasting an increase in the other three biomes (Figs. 7, S26).

*ForC* v3.0 provided unprecedented coverage of most major variables, yielding an internally consistent picture of C cycling in the world's major forest biomes.
Carbon cycling rates generally increased from boreal to tropical regions and with stand age.
Specifically, the major C fluxes were highest in tropical forests, intermediate in temperate (broadleaf or conifer) forests, and lowest in boreal forests -- a pattern that generally held for regrowth as well as mature forests (Figs. 6-7).
In contrast to C fluxes, there was little directional variation in mature forest C stocks across biomes (Figs. 2-5, 7).
The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with stand age (Figs. 6-11).
Together, these results indicate that, moving from cold to tropical climates and from young to old stands, there is a general acceleration of C cycling, whereas C stocks and $NEP$ of mature forests are correlated with a different set of factors.

### C variable coverage and budget closure

The large number of C cycle variables covered by ForC, and the general consistency between them, provide confidence that our overall reported means provide accurate and useful baselines for analysis -- with the caveats that they are unlikely to be accurate representations of C cycling for any particular forest, and that these sample means almost certainly do not represent true biome means (particularly for temperate conifer forests where high-biomass stands are over-represented in *ForC*).

There are of course notable holes in the ForC variable coverage (Fig. 1) that limit the scope of our inferences here. 
Notably, *ForC* currently has sparse--if any--coverage of fluxes to herbivores and higher consumers, along with the woody mortality ($M_{woody}$) and dead wood stocks (Tables 1, Figs. S23-S25). 
Geographically, all variables are poorly covered in Africa and Siberia, a common problem in the carbon-cycle community [@xu_contribution_2016; @schimel_effect_2015]. 
*ForC* does not include soil carbon, which is covered by other efforts [e.g., @kochy_global_2015]. 
*ForC* is not intended to replace databases that are specialized for particular parts of the C cycle analyses, e.g., aboveground biomass [@spawn_harmonized_2020], land-atmosphere fluxes [@baldocchi_fluxnet_2001], soil respiration [@jian_restructured_2020], or the human footprint in global forests [@magnani_human_2007].

In this analysis, the C cycle budgets for mature forests (Figs. 2-5) generally “close”–-that is, the sums of component variables do not differ from the larger fluxes by more than one standard deviation. 
On the one hand, this reflects the general fact that ecosystem-scale measurements tend to close the C budget more easily and consistently than, for example, for energy balance [@stoy_data-driven_2013]. 
On the other, however, *ForC* derives data from multiple heterogeneous sources, and standard deviations within each biome are high; as a result, the standard for C closure is relatively loose [*c.f.* @houghton_terrestrial_2020]. 
Nonetheless, the lack of closure, in the one instance where it occurs, is probably more reflective of differences in the representation of forest types (*i.e.*, disproportionate representation of US Pacific NW for  $B_{root-coarse}$ relative to  $B_{root}$; Fig. 4) than of methodological accuracy. 
The overall high degree of closure implies that *ForC* gives a consistent picture of C cycling within biomes. 
This is an important and useful test, because it allows for consistency checks within the C cycle, for example leveraging separate and independently-measured fluxes to constrain errors in another [@phillips_value_2017; @williams_impacts_2014; @harmon_heterotrophic_2011], or producing internally consistent global data products [@wang_golum-cnp_2018]. 

### C cycling across biomes

Our analysis reveals that carbon cycling is most rapid in the tropics and slowest in boreal regions, including C fluxes into ($GPP$), within (e.g., $NPP$ and its components), and out of (e.g., $R_{soil}$, $R_{eco}$) the ecosystem.
For mature forests, this is consistent with a large body of previous work demonstrating that C fluxes generally decline with latitude (or increase with temperature) on a global scale [e.g., @luyssaert_co2_2007;  @gillman_latitude_2015; @li_mapping_2019; @banbury_morgan_global_nodate].
The consistency with which this occurs across numerous fluxes is not surprising, but has never been simultaneously assessed across such a large number of variables [but see @banbury_morgan_global_nodate for nine autotrophic fluxes].

The notable exception to the pattern of fluxes decreasing from tropical to boreal regions is $NEP$ (Fig. 6f), which showed no significant differences across biomes.
Unlike the other C flux variables, $NEP$ does not characterize the rate at which C cycles through the ecosystem, but is the balance between C sequestration ($GPP$) and respiratory losses ($R_{eco}$) and represents net CO~2~ sequestration (or release) by the ecosystem.
$NEP$ tends to be relatively small in mature forest stands (discussed further below), which accumulate carbon slowly relative to younger stands, if at all [@luyssaert_old-growth_2008; @amiro_ecosystem_2010; @besnard_quantifying_2018].
It is therefore unsurprising that there are no pronounced differences across biomes, suggesting that variation in $NEP$ of mature forests is controlled less by climate and more by other factors including moderate disturbances [@curtis_forest_2018] or disequilibrium of $R_{soil}$ relative to C inputs [e.g., in peatlands where anoxic conditions inhibit decomposition; @wilson_stability_2016].

In contrast to the patterns observed for $NEP$ in mature stands, $NEP$ of stands between 20 and 100 years of age varied across biomes, being lowest in boreal forests, intermediate in temperate broadleaf forests, and highest in temperate conifer forests (with insufficient data to assess tropical forests; Figs. 6f, S1).
This is consistent with findings that live biomass accumulation rates (*e.g.*, $\Delta B_{ag}$ or $\Delta B_{tot}$) during early secondary succession decrease with latitude [Figs. 7a, S16-S22; @anderson_temperature-dependence_2006; @cook-patton_mapping_2020]. 
Note, though, that $NEP$ includes not only $\Delta B_{tot}$, but also changes in $DW_{tot}$, $OL$, and soil carbon, and biome differences in the accumulation rates of these variables have not been detected, in part because these variables do not consistently increase with stand age [Figs. 7, S23-S26, and see discussion below; @cook-patton_mapping_2020].

For regrowth forests, little is known about cross-biome differences in carbon fluxes, and we are not aware of any previous large-scale comparisons of C fluxes that have been limited to regrowth forests. 
Thus, this analysis was the first to examine flux trends in regrowth forests across biomes.
The observed tendency for young forest fluxes to decrease from tropical to boreal regions paralleled patterns in mature forests (Figs. 6, S1-S15), suggesting that regrowth forests follow latitudinal trends in carbon cycling similar to those of mature forests [e.g., @banbury_morgan_global_nodate].

In contrast to C fluxes and biomass accumulation rates in regrowth forests, stocks showed less systematic variation across biomes.
For aboveground biomass, which is the variable in *ForC* with broadest geographical representation, the modest trend of declining biomass from tropical to boreal regions mirrors observations from spaceborne lidar that reveal a decline in aboveground biomass (for all forests, including secondary) with latitude across the N hemisphere [@hu_mapping_2016]. 
The highest- biomass forests on Earth are, however, found in coastal temperate climates of both the southern and northern hemisphere [@keith_re-evaluation_2009; @smithwick_potential_2002; @hu_mapping_2016]. 
Disproportionate representation of forests in one such region--the US Pacific Northwest--inflated estimates of temperate conifer fluxes and stocks for some variables and was responsible for all of the anomalous results described here (e.g., lack of complete C budget closure, anomalous trend across biomes for $BNPP_{coarse}$). 
Thus, biome differences should always be interpreted relative to the geographic distribution of sampling, which only rarely covers the majority of forested area within a biome. 

Whereas biomass can be remotely sensed and receives significant research attention, far less is known about geographical variation in deadwood and organic layer ($OL$) across biomes, which has proved a limitation for C accounting efforts [@pan_large_2011].
Although these stocks can be important--exceeding 100 Mg C ha^-1^ in some stands (Figs. 7d-e, S23-S25), this study is the first to synthesize deadwood data on a global scale [but see @cook-patton_mapping_2020 for young forests].
Unfortunately, data remain too sparse for statistical comparison across biomes (Figs. 7, S23-S25; but see below for age trends), pointing to a need for more widespread quantification of both standing and downed deadwood.
*ForC* coverage of $OL$ stocks is more comprehensive, revealing no significant differences across temperate and tropical biomes, but a tendency towards higher $OL$ in boreal forests, consistent with the idea that slower decomposition in colder climates results in more buildup of organic matter [@allen_global_2002]. 
Further research on non-living C stocks in the world's forests will be essential to completing the picture.

### Age trends in C cycling  

Our study reveals that most C fluxes quickly increase to a plateau as stands age (Fig. 6), consistent with current understanding of age trends in forest C cycling [e.g., @andersonteixeira_altered_2013; @amiro_ecosystem_2010; @magnani_human_2007].
While limited records in very young (*i.e.*, <5 year old) stands resulted in poor resolution of the earliest phases of this increase for many variables (sometimes detecting no age trend; Table 1), any autotrophic C flux (e.g., $GPP$, $NPP$ and its components, $R_auto$) would be minimal immediately following a stand-clearing disturbance.
These would be expected to increase rapidly with the most metabolically active components of biomass, foliage and fine roots, which also increase rapidly with stand age (Fig. 7).
In contrast, soil heterotrophic respiration ($R_{het-soil}$) and total soil respiration ($R_{soil}$) are expected to be non-zero following stand-clearing disturbance, although these may decrease with a reduction of root respiration ($R_{soil}$ only) and C exudates or increase in response to an influx of dead roots and litter [@ribeiro-kumara_how_2020; @maurer_carbon_2016; @bond-lamberty_contribution_2004].
In this study, we detect no significant age trends in either variable.

Notably, net carbon sequestration ($NEP$) increases with age up to the 100-yr threshold examined here, with more pronounced patterns in temperate than boreal forests (Fig. 6f). 
This finding is largely consistent with, but built from a far larger dataset than, previous studies showing an increase in $NEP$ across relatively young stand ages [@pregitzer_carbon_2004; @baldocchi_fluxnet_2001; @luyssaert_old-growth_2008].
However, $NEP$ has been observed to decline from intermediate to old stands [@luyssaert_old-growth_2008], and the $NEP$ estimated by our model for 100-year-old temperate conifer stands (~5 Mg C ha^-1^ yr^-1^) exceeds the mean of mature forests in the same biome (0.7 Mg C ha^-1^ yr^-1^; Fig.4).
A decrease in $NEP$ is consistent with the observed deceleration of biomass accumulation as stands age, although both biomass and non-living C stocks will often continue to increase well beyond the 100-yr threshold used here to delimit young and mature stands [@luyssaert_old-growth_2008; @mcgarvey_carbon_2014; @lichstein_biomass_2009].

In terms of stocks, our study reveals consistent increases in live biomass stocks with stand age--a pattern that is well-known and expected [e.g., @lichstein_biomass_2009; @yang_carbon_2011]--and more variable age trends in deadwood and $OL$.
The latter are particularly sensitive to the type of disturbance, where disturbances that remove most organic material (e.g., logging, agriculture) result in negligible deadwood in young stands, followed by a buildup over time [tropical stands in Fig. 7e; e.g., @vargas_biomass_2008].
In contrast, natural disturbances (e.g., fire, drought) can produce large amounts of deadwood (mostly $DW_{standing}$) that slowly decomposes as the stand recovers, resulting in declines across young stand ages [e.g., temperate and boreal stands in Fig. 7e; e.g., @carmona_coarse_2002].
Again, further study and synthesis of non-living C stocks across biomes and stand ages will be valuable to giving a more comprehensive picture. 

### Relevance for climate change prediction and mitigation

The future of forest C cycling [@song_meta-analysis_2019] will shape trends in atmospheric CO~2~ and the course of climate change [@schimel_effect_2015].
Our findings, and more generally the data contained in *ForC* and summarized here, can help to meet two major challenges.

First, improved representation of forest C cycling in models is essential to improving predictions of the future course of climate change, for the simple reason that by definition future projections extend our existing observations and understanding to conditions that do not currently exist on Earth [@mcdowell_predicting_2018; @bonan_climate_2018; @gustafson_extrapolating_2018]. 
To ensure that models are giving the right answers for the right reasons [@sulman_multiple_2018], it is important to benchmark against multiple components of the C cycle that are internally consistent with each other [@collier_international_2018; @wang_golum-cnp_2018]. 
*ForC*’s tens of thousands of records are readily available in a standardized format, and our analyses here indicate that their internal consistency is reasonably high. Integration of *ForC* with models will be valuable to improving the accuracy and reliability of models. 

Second, *ForC* can serve as a pipeline through which information can flow efficiently from forest researchers to decision-makers working to implement forest conservation strategies at global, national, or landscape scales. 
This is already happening: *ForC* has contributed to updating the IPCC guidelines for carbon accounting in forests [@ipcc_2019_2019; @requena_suarez_estimating_2019], mapping C accumulation potential from natural forest regrowth globally [@cook-patton_mapping_2020], and informing ecosystem conservation priorities [@goldstein_protecting_2020].

It is also interesting to consider the complementary utility of global-scale but spatially discontinuous databases such as ForC and remote wall-to-wall remote sensing products. The latter provide unparalleled insight into aboveground carbon stocks, but less constraint on belowground stocks or carbon fluxes in general [@bondlamberty_estimating_2016; @anav_spatiotemporal_2015]. 
Combining observational data and remote observations may provide a much more comprehensive and accurate picture of global forest C cycling, particularly when used in formal data assimilation systems [@konings_global_2019; @liu_detecting_2018].
Biomass is the largest C stock in most forests, and most of the emphasis has traditionally been on this variable. 
Remote-sensing driven biomass estimates [e.g., @saatchi_benchmark_2011], calibrated based on high-quality ground-based data [@schepaschenko_forest_2019; @chave_ground_2019], are well suited for this task. 
Note, however, that factors such as stand age and disturbance history are difficult, if possible, to detect remotely, and can only be characterized for very recent decades [@hansen_high-resolution_2013; @song_global_2018; @curtis_classifying_2018]. 
Ground-based data such as *ForC* are therefore valuable in defining age-based trajectories in biomass, as in @cook-patton_mapping_2020, and thus constraining variables such as carbon sink potential [@luyssaert_old-growth_2008].

In contrast, carbon allocation within forest ecosystems and respiration fluxes cannot be remotely sensed. 
Efforts such as the Global Carbon Project [@friedlingstein_global_2019] and NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System [@liu_detecting_2018] typically compute respiration as residuals of all other terms [@bondlamberty_estimating_2016; @harmon_heterotrophic_2011]. 
This means that the errors on respiration outputs are likely to be large and certainly poorly constrained, offering a unique opportunity for databases such as ForC and SRDB [@jian_restructured_2020] to provide observational benchmarks. 
For example, @konings_global_2019 produced a unique top-down estimate of global heterotrophic respiration that can both be compared with extant bottom-up estimates [@bondlamberty_new_2018] and used as an internal consistency check on other parts of the carbon cycle [@phillips_value_2017].

### Conclusions
As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests--notably including dynamics and fluxes that cannot be observed by satellites--is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation.
The C data in *ForC*, as summarized here, will be valuable to these efforts.
Notably, the fact that tropical forests tend to have both the highest rates of C sequestration in young stands [Fig. 7; @cook-patton_mapping_2020], fueled by their generally high C flux rates (Table 1; Fig. 6), and the highest mean biomass [Fig. 7; Table 1; @hu_mapping_2016; @jian_restructured_2020] reinforces the concept that conservation and restoration of these forests is a priority for climate change mitigation, along with high-biomass old-growth temperate stands [@grassi_key_2017; @goldstein_protecting_2020].
It is also important to note the trade-off in climate mitigation potential of restoration of young forests, with high rates of CO~2~ sequestration [$NEP$; @cook-patton_mapping_2020], versus conservation and management of mature forests, with low $NEP$ but high C stocks that could not be recovered on a time scale relevant to climate change mitigation [@goldstein_protecting_2020].
Generally speaking, the conservation of mature forests will yield greater climate benefits [@anderson-teixeira_greenhouse_2011], but both approaches are critical to avoiding catastrophic climate change [@ipcc_global_2018].
