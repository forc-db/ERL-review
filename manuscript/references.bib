	abstract = {The terrestrial carbon (C) sink has been large in recent decades, but its size and location remain uncertain. Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem C studies, we estimated a total forest sink of 2.4 Â± 0.4 Pg C yrâ€“1 globally for 1990â€“2007. We also estimated a source of 1.3 Â± 0.7 Pg C yrâ€“1 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 Â± 0.5 Pg C yrâ€“1 partially compensated by a C sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 Â± 0.5 Pg C yrâ€“1. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 Â± 0.8 Pg C yrâ€“1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. This forest sink is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and constraints of ocean and atmospheric sinks.},

	abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25 ha), all stems ≥1 cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25°S–61°N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61 °C), changes in precipitation (up to ±30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8 g N m−2 yr−1 and 3.1 g S m−2 yr−1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5 km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests play a critical role in the global carbon (C) cycle, storing {\textasciitilde}45\% of terrestrial C and constituting the largest component of the terrestrial C sink. Despite their central importance to the global C cycle, their ecosystem-level C cycles are not as well-characterized as those of extra-tropical forests, and knowledge gaps hamper efforts to quantify C budgets across the tropics and to model tropical forest-climate interactions. To advance understanding of C dynamics of pantropical forests, we compiled a new database, the Tropical Forest C database (TropForC-db), which contains data on ground-based measurements of ecosystem-level C stocks and annual fluxes along with disturbance history. This database currently contains 3568 records from 845 plots in 178 geographically distinct areas, making it the largest and most comprehensive database of its type. Using TropForC-db, we characterized C stocks and fluxes for young, intermediate-aged, and mature forests. Relative to existing C budgets of extra-tropical forests, mature tropical broadleaf evergreen forests had substantially higher gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), their autotropic respiration (Ra) consumed a larger proportion ({\textasciitilde}67\%) of GPP, and their woody stem growth (ANPPstem) represented a smaller proportion of net primary productivity (NPP, {\textasciitilde}32\%) or GPP ({\textasciitilde}9\%). In regrowth stands, aboveground biomass increased rapidly during the first 20 years following stand-clearing disturbance, with slower accumulation following agriculture and in deciduous forests, and continued to accumulate at a slower pace in forests aged 20–100 years. Most other C stocks likewise increased with stand age, while potential to describe age trends in C fluxes was generally data-limited. We expect that TropForC-db will prove useful for model evaluation and for quantifying the contribution of forests to the global C cycle. The database version associated with this publication is archived in Dryad (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.t516f) and a dynamic version is maintained at https://github.com/forc-db.},

	abstract = {FLUXNET is a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites that measure the exchanges of  carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. At present over 140 sites are operating  on a long–term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous  and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five  continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70°N to 30°S. FLUXNET has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and  distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community.  (Data and site information are available online at the FLUXNET http://www–eosdis.ornl.gov/FLUXNET/.)  Second, the project supports calibration and flux intercomparison activities. This activity ensures that data from the  regional networks are intercomparable. And third, FLUXNET supports the synthesis, discussion, and communication of  ideas and data by supporting project scientists, workshops, and visiting scientists. The overarching goal is to provide  information for validating computations of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption that are  being generated by sensors mounted on the NASA  Terra satellite. Data being compiled by FLUXNET are being used to quantify and compare magnitudes and dynamics of  annual ecosystem carbon and water balances, to quantify the response of stand–scale carbon dioxide and water vapor  flux densities to controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and to validate a hierarchy of soil–plant–atmosphere trace gas  exchange models. Findings so far include 1) net  CO2 exchange of temperate broadleaved forests increases by  about 5.7 g C m–2 day–1 for each additional day that the growing season is extended; 2) the sensitivity of net ecosystem  CO2 exchange to sunlight doubles if the sky is cloudy rather than clear; 3) the spectrum of  CO2 flux density exhibits peaks at timescales of days, weeks, and years, and a spectral gap exists at the month timescale; 4) the optimal  temperature of net CO2 exchange varies with mean summer temperature; and 5) stand age affects carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities.},

Yet the inclusion of forests in international climate agreements has been complex, often considered a secondary mitigation option. In the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, countries submitted their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions ((I)NDCs), including climate mitigation targets. Assuming full implementation of (I)NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990–2010 (1.3 ± 1.1 GtCO2e yr−1) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to −1.1 ± 0.5 GtCO2e yr−1), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries. Realizing and tracking this mitigation potential requires more transparency in countries’ pledges and enhanced science-policy cooperation to increase confidence in numbers, including reconciling the ≈3 GtCO2e yr−1 difference in estimates between country reports and scientific studies.},

	abstract = {As countries advance in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for climate change mitigation, consistent estimates of aboveground net biomass change (∆AGB) are needed. Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default ∆AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old-growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate ∆AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old-growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated ∆AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests (≤20 years), older secondary forests ({\textgreater}20 years and up to 100 years) and old-growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our ∆AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in old-growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on ∆AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large-scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research.},

	abstract = {Accurately quantifying gross primary production (GPP) globally is critical for assessing plant productivity, carbon balance, and carbon-climate feedbacks, while current GPP estimates exhibit substantial uncertainty. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has offered unprecedented opportunities for monitoring land photosynthesis, while its sparse coverage remains a bottleneck for mapping finer-resolution GPP globally. Here, we used the global, OCO-2-based SIF product (GOSIF) and linear relationships between SIF and GPP to map GPP globally at a 0.05\&deg; spatial resolution and 8-day time step for the period from 2000 to 2017. To account for the uncertainty of GPP estimates resulting from the SIF-GPP relationship, we used a total of eight SIF-GPP relationships with different forms (universal and biome-specific, with and without intercept) at both site and grid cell levels to estimate GPP. Our results showed that all of the eight SIF-GPP relationships performed well in estimating GPP globally. The ensemble mean 8-day GPP was generally highly correlated with flux tower GPP for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe (R2 = 0.74, Root Mean Square Error = 1.92 g C m\&minus;2 d\&minus;1). Our fine-resolution GPP estimates showed reasonable spatial and seasonal variations across the globe and fully captured both seasonal cycles and spatial patterns present in our coarse-resolution (1\&deg;) GPP estimates based on coarse-resolution SIF data directly aggregated from discrete OCO-2 soundings. SIF-GPP relationships with different forms could lead to significant differences in annual GPP particularly in the tropics. Our ensemble global annual GPP estimate (135.5 \&plusmn; 8.8 Pg C yr\&minus;1) is between the median estimate of non-process based methods and the median estimate of process-based models. Our GPP estimates showed interannual variability in many regions and exhibited increasing trends in many parts of the globe particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. With the availability of high-quality, gridded SIF observations from space (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX), our novel approach does not rely on any other input data (e.g., climate data, soil properties) and therefore can map GPP solely based on satellite SIF observations and potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates at regional to global scales. The use of a universal SIF-GPP relationship versus biome-specific relationships can also avoid the uncertainty associated with land cover maps. Our novel, independent GPP product (GOSIF GPP), freely available at our data repository, will be valuable for studying photosynthesis, carbon cycle, agricultural production, and ecosystem responses to climate change and disturbances, informing ecosystem management, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.},

Using a calibration factor derived from ground inspection of tree deaths predicted from the images, we calculated a landscape-scale annual exponential death rate of 2.8\%. This corresponds closely to data for all canopy-level trees in 18 forest inventory plots, each of 0.5 ha, for a mostly-overlapping 2-year period (2.8\% per year).

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems sequester 2.1 Pg of atmospheric carbon annually. A large amount of the terrestrial sink is realized by forests. However, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of this carbon over both short and long timescales. Relevant data to address these uncertainties are being collected at many sites around the world, but syntheses of these data are still sparse. To facilitate future synthesis activities, we have assembled a comprehensive global database for forest ecosystems, which includes carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (e.g. leaf area index, age), as well as ancillary site information such as management regime, climate, and soil characteristics. This publicly available database can be used to quantify global, regional or biome-specific carbon budgets; to re-examine established relationships; to test emerging hypotheses about ecosystem functioning [e.g. a constant net ecosystem production (NEP) to gross primary production (GPP) ratio]; and as benchmarks for model evaluations. In this paper, we present the first analysis of this database. We discuss the climatic influences on GPP, net primary production (NPP) and NEP and present the CO2 balances for boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes based on micrometeorological, ecophysiological, and biometric flux and inventory estimates. Globally, GPP of forests benefited from higher temperatures and precipitation whereas NPP saturated above either a threshold of 1500 mm precipitation or a mean annual temperature of 10 °C. The global pattern in NEP was insensitive to climate and is hypothesized to be mainly determined by nonclimatic conditions such as successional stage, management, site history, and site disturbance. In all biomes, closing the CO2 balance required the introduction of substantial biome-specific closure terms. Nonclosure was taken as an indication that respiratory processes, advection, and non-CO2 carbon fluxes are not presently being adequately accounted for.},

	abstract = {Several remote sensing missions will soon produce detailed carbon maps over all terrestrial ecosystems. These missions are dependent on accurate and representative in situ datasets for the training of their algorithms and product validation. However, long-term ground-based forest-monitoring systems are limited, especially in the tropics, and to be useful for validation, such ground-based observation systems need to be regularly revisited and maintained at least over the lifetime of the planned missions. Here we propose a strategy for a coordinated and global network of in situ data that would benefit biomass remote sensing missions. We propose to build upon existing networks of long-term tropical forest monitoring. To produce accurate ground-based biomass estimates, strict data quality must be guaranteed to users. It is more rewarding to invest ground resources at sites where there currently is assurance of a long-term commitment locally and where a core set of data is already available. We call these ‘supersites’. Long-term funding for such an inter-agency endeavour remains an important challenge, and we here provide costing estimates to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders. One critical requirement is to ensure in situ data availability over the lifetime of remote sensing missions. To this end, consistent guidelines for supersite selection and management are proposed within the Forest Observation System, long-term funding should be assured, and principal investigators of the sites should be actively involved.},
