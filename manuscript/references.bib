Here we show that species diversity can be predicted from the biochemical kinetics of metabolism. We first demonstrate that the average energy flux of populations is temperature invariant. We then derive a model that quantitatively predicts how species diversity increases with environmental temperature. Predictions are supported by data for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine taxa along latitudinal and elevational gradients. These results establish a thermodynamic basis for the regulation of species diversity and the organization of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Disturbances are important for renewal of North American forests. Here we summarize more than 180 site years of eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide flux made at forest chronosequences in North America. The disturbances included stand-replacing fire (Alaska, Arizona, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan) and harvest (British Columbia, Florida, New Brunswick, Oregon, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Wisconsin) events, insect infestations (gypsy moth, forest tent caterpillar, and mountain pine beetle), Hurricane Wilma, and silvicultural thinning (Arizona, California, and New Brunswick). Net ecosystem production (NEP) showed a carbon loss from all ecosystems following a stand-replacing disturbance, becoming a carbon sink by 20 years for all ecosystems and by 10 years for most. Maximum carbon losses following disturbance (g C m-2y-1) ranged from 1270 in Florida to 200 in boreal ecosystems. Similarly, for forests less than 100 years old, maximum uptake (g C m-2y-1) was 1180 in Florida mangroves and 210 in boreal ecosystems. More temperate forests had intermediate fluxes. Boreal ecosystems were relatively time invariant after 20 years, whereas western ecosystems tended to increase in carbon gain over time. This was driven mostly by gross photosynthetic production (GPP) because total ecosystem respiration (ER) and heterotrophic respiration were relatively invariant with age. GPP/ER was as low as 0.2 immediately following stand-replacing disturbance reaching a constant value of 1.2 after 20 years. NEP following insect defoliations and silvicultural thinning showed lesser changes than stand-replacing events, with decreases in the year of disturbance followed by rapid recovery. NEP decreased in a mangrove ecosystem following Hurricane Wilma because of a decrease in GPP and an increase in ER.},

  abstract = {Great advances have been made in the last decade in quantifying and understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) with ground, atmospheric, and space observations. However, although global GPP estimates exist, each data set relies upon assumptions and none of the available data are based only on measurements. Consequently, there is no consensus on the global total GPP and large uncertainties exist in its benchmarking. The objective of this review is to assess how the different available data sets predict the spatiotemporal patterns of GPP, identify the differences among data sets, and highlight the main advantages/disadvantages of each data set. We compare GPP estimates for the historical period (1990\textendash 2009) from two observation-based data sets (Model Tree Ensemble and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to coupled carbon-climate models and terrestrial carbon cycle models from the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project and TRENDY projects and to a new hybrid data set (CARBONES). Results show a large range in the mean global GPP estimates. The different data sets broadly agree on GPP seasonal cycle in terms of phasing, while there is still discrepancy on the amplitude. For interannual variability (IAV) and trends, there is a clear separation between the observation-based data that show little IAV and trend, while the process-based models have large GPP variability and significant trends. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to improve observation-based data sets and develop carbon cycle modeling with processes that are currently treated either very simplistically to correctly estimate present GPP and better quantify the future uptake of carbon dioxide by the world's vegetation.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests play a critical role in the global carbon (C) cycle, storing \textasciitilde 45\% of terrestrial C and constituting the largest component of the terrestrial C sink. Despite their central importance to the global C cycle, their ecosystem-level C cycles are not as well-characterized as those of extra-tropical forests, and knowledge gaps hamper efforts to quantify C budgets across the tropics and to model tropical forest-climate interactions. To advance understanding of C dynamics of pantropical forests, we compiled a new database, the Tropical Forest C database (TropForC-db), which contains data on ground-based measurements of ecosystem-level C stocks and annual fluxes along with disturbance history. This database currently contains 3568 records from 845 plots in 178 geographically distinct areas, making it the largest and most comprehensive database of its type. Using TropForC-db, we characterized C stocks and fluxes for young, intermediate-aged, and mature forests. Relative to existing C budgets of extra-tropical forests, mature tropical broadleaf evergreen forests had substantially higher gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco), their autotropic respiration (Ra) consumed a larger proportion (\textasciitilde 67\%) of GPP, and their woody stem growth (ANPPstem) represented a smaller proportion of net primary productivity (NPP, \textasciitilde 32\%) or GPP (\textasciitilde 9\%). In regrowth stands, aboveground biomass increased rapidly during the first 20~years following stand-clearing disturbance, with slower accumulation following agriculture and in deciduous forests, and continued to accumulate at a slower pace in forests aged 20\textendash 100~years. Most other C stocks likewise increased with stand age, while potential to describe age trends in C fluxes was generally data-limited. We expect that TropForC-db will prove useful for model evaluation and for quantifying the contribution of forests to the global C cycle.

  abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25~ha), all stems {$\geq$}1~cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25\textdegree S\textendash 61\textdegree N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61~\textdegree C), changes in precipitation (up to {$\pm$}30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8~g N~m-2~yr-1 and 3.1~g S~m-2~yr-1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5~km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

  abstract = {Forest regeneration following disturbance is a key ecological process, influencing forest structure and function, species assemblages, and ecosystem\textendash climate interactions. Climate change may alter forest recovery dynamics or even prevent recovery, triggering feedbacks to the climate system, altering regional biodiversity, and affecting the ecosystem services provided by forests. Multiple lines of evidence \textendash{} including global-scale patterns in forest recovery dynamics; forest responses to experimental manipulation of CO2, temperature, and precipitation; forest responses to the climate change that has already occurred; ecological theory; and ecosystem and earth system models \textendash{} all indicate that the dynamics of forest recovery are sensitive to climate. However, synthetic understanding of how atmospheric CO2 and climate shape trajectories of forest recovery is lacking. Here, we review these separate lines of evidence, which together demonstrate that the dynamics of forest recovery are being impacted by increasing atmospheric CO2 and changing climate. Rates of forest recovery generally increase with CO2, temperature, and water availability. Drought reduces growth and live biomass in forests of all ages, having a particularly strong effect on seedling recruitment and survival. Responses of individual trees and whole-forest ecosystems to CO2 and climate manipulations often vary by age, implying that forests of different ages will respond differently to climate change. Furthermore, species within a community typically exhibit differential responses to CO2 and climate, and altered community dynamics can have important consequences for ecosystem function. Age- and species-dependent responses provide a mechanism by which climate change may push some forests past critical thresholds such that they fail to recover to their previous state following disturbance. Altered dynamics of forest recovery will result in positive and negative feedbacks to climate change. Future research on this topic and corresponding improvements to earth system models will be a key to understanding the future of forests and their feedbacks to the climate system.},

  abstract = {Southwestern North America faces an imminent transition to a warmer, more arid climate, and it is critical to understand how these changes will affect the carbon balance of southwest ecosystems. In order to test our hypothesis that differential responses of production and respiration to temperature and moisture shape the carbon balance across a range of spatio-temporal scales, we quantified net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and carbon storage across the New Mexico Elevational Gradient, which consists of six eddy-covariance sites representing biomes ranging from desert to subalpine conifer forest. Within sites, hotter and drier conditions were associated with an increasing advantage of respiration relative to production such that daily carbon uptake peaked at intermediate temperatures \textendash{} with carbon release often occurring on the hottest days \textendash{} and increased with soil moisture. Across sites, biotic adaptations modified but did not override the dominant effects of climate. Carbon uptake increased with decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation across the elevational gradient; NEE ranged from a source of {$\sim$}30~g~C~m-2~yr-1 in the desert grassland to a sink of {$\sim$}350~g~C~m-2~yr-1 in the subalpine conifer forest. Total aboveground carbon storage increased dramatically with elevation, ranging from 186~g~C~m-2 in the desert grassland to 26~600~g~C~m-2 in the subalpine conifer forest. These results make sense in the context of global patterns in NEE and biomass storage, and support that increasing temperature and decreasing moisture shift the carbon balance of ecosystems in favor of respiration, such that the potential for ecosystems to sequester and store carbon is reduced under hot and/or dry conditions. This implies that projected climate change will trigger a substantial net release of carbon in these New Mexico ecosystems ({$\sim$}3~Gt CO2 statewide by the end of the century), thereby acting as a positive feedback to climate change.},

Scaling the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and NIRV from FLUXNET eddy covariance sites, we estimate global annual terrestrial photosynthesis to be 147 Pg C/year (95\% credible interval 131\textendash 163 Pg C/year), which falls between bottom-up GPP estimates and the top-down global constraint on GPP from oxygen isotopes. NIRV-derived estimates of GPP are systematically higher than existing bottom-up estimates, especially throughout the midlatitudes. Progress in improving estimated GPP from NIRV can come from improved cloud screening in satellite data and increased resolution of vegetation characteristics, especially details about plant photosynthetic pathway.},

Other topics discussed include history of the network, errors and issues associated with the eddy covariance method, and a synopsis of how these data are being used by ecosystem and climate modellers and the remote-sensing community. Spatial and temporal differences in net annual exchange, FN, result from imbalances in canopy photosynthesis (FA) and ecosystem respiration (FR), which scale closely with one another on annual time scales. Key findings reported include the following: (1) ecosystems with the greatest net carbon uptake have the longest growing season, not the greatest FA; (2) ecosystems losing carbon were recently disturbed; (3) many old-growth forests act as carbon sinks; and (4) year-to-year decreases in FN are attributed to a suite of stresses that decrease FA and FR in tandem. Short-term flux measurements revealed emergent-scale processes including (1) the enhancement of light use efficiency by diffuse light, (2) dynamic pulses in FR following rain and (3) the acclimation FA and FR to temperature. They also quantify how FA and FR respond to droughts and heat spells.},

  abstract = {Integrating the biosphere into climate models High-quality climate predictions are crucial for understanding the impacts of different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and for mitigating and adapting to the resulting climatic changes. Bonan and Doney review advances in Earth system models that include the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Such models capture interactions between physical and biological aspects of the Earth system. This provides insight into climate impacts of societal importance, such as altered crop yields, wildfire risk, and water availability. Further research is needed to better understand model uncertainties, some of which may be unavoidable, and to better translate observations into abstract model representations. Science, this issue p. eaam8328 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDEarth system models (ESMs) simulate physical, chemical, and biological processes that underlie climate and are the most complex in a hierarchy of models of Earth's interacting atmosphere\textendash land\textendash ocean\textendash sea ice system. As terrestrial and marine ecosystems have been added to ESMs, the distinction between the physical basis for climate change, mitigation, and vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation (VIA) no longer necessarily holds. The same global change stresses that affect terrestrial and marine ecosystems are critical processes that determine the magnitude and trajectory of climate change, and many of the interventions that might lessen anthropogenic climate change pertain to the biosphere. Here we describe environmental changes that are stressing terrestrial and marine ecosystems. We discuss how these stressors are being included in ESMs, initially with an emphasis on climate processes, but also show their emerging utility for VIA analyses and examine them in the context of Earth system prediction. ADVANCESTerrestrial ecosystems face stresses from changing climate and atmospheric composition that alter phenology, growing season length, and community composition; these stresses enhance productivity and water-use efficiency in some regions, but also lead to mortality and increased disturbances from wildfires, insects, and extreme events in other regions. The addition of reactive nitrogen, elevated levels of tropospheric O3, and anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change stress ecosystems as well. The terrestrial biosphere models included in ESMs simulate the ecological impacts of these stresses and their effects on Earth system functioning. Ocean ecosystems and living marine resources face threats from ocean warming, changing large-scale circulation, increased vertical stratification, declining oxygen, and acidification, which alter nutrient supply, the light environment, and phytoplankton productivity; result in coral bleaching; and produce novel marine communities. Three-dimensional ocean models simulate the carbon cycle and associated biogeochemistry. Plankton ecosystem models both drive biogeochemistry models and characterize marine ecological dynamics. OUTLOOKThe untapped potential of ESMs is to bring dispersed terrestrial and marine ecosystem research related to climate processes, VIA, and mitigation into a common framework. ESMs offer an opportunity to move beyond physical descriptors of atmospheric and oceanic states to societally relevant quantities such as habitat loss, water availability, wildfire risk, air quality, and crop, fishery, and timber yields. To do so, the science of climate prediction has to be extended to a more multifaceted Earth system prediction, including the biosphere and its resources. ESMs provide the means not just to assess the potential for future global change stresses, but also to determine the outcome of those stresses on the biosphere. Such Earth system prediction is necessary to inform sound policy that maintains a healthy biosphere and provides the food, energy, and fresh water needed for a growing global population without further exacerbating climate change. Substantial impediments that must be overcome include advancing our knowledge of biosphere-related climate processes; reducing model uncertainty; and effectively communicating among, rather than across, the disparate science communities of climate prediction, global biosphere modeling, VIA analyses, and climate change mitigation. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.smithsonian.idm.oclc.org/content/sci/359/6375/eaam8328/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The various models used for climate projections and mitigation and VIA analyses overlap in scope and would benefit from a broad perspective of Earth system prediction.Shown are the domains of ESMs, mitigation models, and VIA models along axes from VIA to climate processes (horizontal) and from primarily serving the research community to informing societal needs (vertical). Panels show forests and agriculture (left) and marine ecosystems (right) as represented across modeling domains. Many global change stresses on terrestrial and marine ecosystems affect not only ecosystem services that are essential to humankind, but also the trajectory of future climate by altering energy and mass exchanges with the atmosphere. Earth system models, which simulate terrestrial and marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, offer a common framework for ecological research related to climate processes; analyses of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation; and climate change mitigation. They provide an opportunity to move beyond physical descriptors of atmospheric and oceanic states to societally relevant quantities such as wildfire risk, habitat loss, water availability, and crop, fishery, and timber yields. To achieve this, the science of climate prediction must be extended to a more multifaceted Earth system prediction that includes the biosphere and its resources.},

It will take a combination of long-term studies, data syntheses, modeling intercomparisons, and probably a new generation of sampling networks and experiments to fully resolve these questions.},

  abstract = {Secondary forests and monoculture plantations are widespread in the tropics and are the two most common forms of reforestation. To assess the value of both systems for CO2 mitigation, we performed a systematic analysis of the two systems comparing growth rates and potential to store carbon. The increasing involvement of these forest types in carbon trading makes a pertinent issue. We used a meta-analytical approach to evaluate relative rates of aboveground growth (biomass accumulation) in secondary forests and monoculture plantations, controlling for climate and site characteristics. We find a general tendency for aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) to be marginally higher in plantations than secondary forests. Three recorded site factors were significantly associated with ABA, but differed between reforestation types. Plantation growth rates were negatively correlated with precipitation seasonality, while growth rates of secondary forest were positively correlated with surrounding tree cover and negatively correlated with duration of prior land use. It is noteworthy that poor reporting of site history such as prior land-use duration, particularly in monoculture plantations, and a strong bias in studies towards measuring young forest plots obfuscates evaluation of some ecological drivers and long-term processes. We conclude that the difference in ABA between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations is smaller than previously assumed, emphasising the potential of secondary forests for low-cost carbon storage and biomass production, particularly in landscapes with high existing tree cover or highly seasonal rainfall.},

Decaying logs and snags provide habitat for many organisms and participate in biogeochemical element fluxes within the forest ecosystem. Because of their large mass and slow decay rates, they may also play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. For these reasons, it is important to understand the dynamics of coarse woody debris (CWD) during forest succession. Here, we estimated the biomass of CWD (defined as logs or snags {$>$}10cm stem diameter) in nine forest stands, both primary and secondary, on Chilo\'e Island (42\textdegree S), southern Chile. The stands represented a successional chronosequence following non-catastrophic human disturbance by fire and logging. We characterized logs in terms of their decay class, total carbon content, moisture content, volume, and dry biomass. CWD biomass ranged from 18 to 413Mgha-1, with a recently disturbed and old-growth forests having the largest values. Early- and mid-successional stands had the lowest values. Decay classes of logs differed in density, moisture contents and total carbon content. Carbon stored in logs and snags was nearly 10 times higher in old-growth and primary forests than in young-successional forests. CWD biomass is substantially reduced in young growing stands with disrupting effects on ecological functions and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Although tropical forests account for only a fraction of the planet's terrestrial surface, they exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other biome on Earth, and thus play a disproportionate role in the global climate. In the next 20 years, the tropics will experience unprecedented warming, yet there is exceedingly high uncertainty about their potential responses to this imminent climatic change. Here, we prioritize research approaches given both funding and logistical constraints in order to resolve major uncertainties about how tropical forests function and also to improve predictive capacity of earth system models. We investigate overall model uncertainty of tropical latitudes and explore the scientific benefits and inevitable trade-offs inherent in large-scale manipulative field experiments. With a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 analysis, we found that model variability in projected net ecosystem production was nearly 3 times greater in the tropics than for any other latitude. Through a review of the most current literature, we concluded that manipulative warming experiments are vital to accurately predict future tropical forest carbon balance, and we further recommend the establishment of a network of comparable studies spanning gradients of precipitation, edaphic qualities, plant types, and/or land use change. We provide arguments for long-term, single-factor warming experiments that incorporate warming of the most biogeochemically active ecosystem components (i.e. leaves, roots, soil microbes). Hypothesis testing of underlying mechanisms should be a priority, along with improving model parameterization and constraints. No single tropical forest is representative of all tropical forests; therefore logistical feasibility should be the most important consideration for locating large-scale manipulative experiments. Above all, we advocate for multi-faceted research programs, and we offer arguments for what we consider the most powerful and urgent way forward in order to improve our understanding of tropical forest responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract  Recent projections of climatic change have focused a great deal of scientific and public attention on patterns of carbon (C) cycling as well as its controls, particularly the factors that determine whether an ecosystem is a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Net ecosystem production (NEP), a central concept in C-cycling research, has been used by scientists to represent two different concepts. We propose that NEP be restricted to just one of its two original definitions\textemdash the imbalance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We further propose that a new term\textemdash net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)\textemdash be applied to the net rate of C accumulation in (or loss from [negative sign]) ecosystems. Net ecosystem carbon balance differs from NEP when C fluxes other than C fixation and respiration occur, or when inorganic C enters or leaves in dissolved form. These fluxes include the leaching loss or lateral transfer of C from the ecosystem; the emission of volatile organic C, methane, and carbon monoxide; and the release of soot and CO2 from fire. Carbon fluxes in addition to NEP are particularly important determinants of NECB over long time scales. However, even over short time scales, they are important in ecosystems such as streams, estuaries, wetlands, and cities. Recent technological advances have led to a diversity of approaches to the measurement of C fluxes at different temporal and spatial scales. These approaches frequently capture different components of NEP or NECB and can therefore be compared across scales only by carefully specifying the fluxes included in the measurements. By explicitly identifying the fluxes that comprise NECB and other components of the C cycle, such as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome production (NBP), we can provide a less ambiguous framework for understanding and communicating recent changes in the global C cycle.},

  abstract = {Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km2 of land (28.1\% of the total study area). Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from 1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95\% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40\% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-cost mechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Models reveal the high carbon mitigation potential of tropical forest regeneration. Models reveal the high carbon mitigation potential of tropical forest regeneration.},

We used 1-m resolution panchromatic IKONOS and 0.7-m resolution QuickBird satellite data, acquired in 2000 and 2002, respectively, to evaluate tree death rates at the La Selva Biological Station in old-growth Tropical Wet Forest in Costa Rica, Central America. Using a calibration factor derived from ground inspection of tree deaths predicted from the images, we calculated a landscape-scale annual exponential death rate of 2.8\%. This corresponds closely to data for all canopy-level trees in 18 forest inventory plots, each of 0.5 ha, for a mostly-overlapping 2-year period (2.8\% per year). This study shows that high-spatial-resolution satellite data can now be used to measure old-growth tropical rain forest tree death rates, suggesting many new avenues for tropical forest ecology and global change research.},

We present a global analysis of the relationship of FPE to stand-age and climate, based on a large compilation of data on gross primary production and either BP or NPP. FPE is important for both forest production and atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake. We find that FPE increases with absolute latitude, precipitation and (all else equal) with temperature. Earlier findings\textemdash FPE declining with age\textemdash are also supported by this analysis. However, the temperature effect is opposite to what would be expected based on the short-term physiological response of respiration rates to temperature, implying a top-down regulation of carbon loss, perhaps reflecting the higher carbon costs of nutrient acquisition in colder climates. Current ecosystem models do not reproduce this phenomenon. They consistently predict lower FPE in warmer climates, and are therefore likely to overestimate carbon losses in a warming climate.},

Earth system models exhibit a high degree of spread in predictions of land biogeochemistry, biogeophysics, and hydrology, which are sensitive to forcing from other model components. Based on insights from prior land model evaluation studies and community workshops, the authors developed an open source model benchmarking software package that generates graphical diagnostics and scores model performance in support of the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project. Employing a suite of in situ, remote sensing, and reanalysis data sets, the ILAMB package performs comprehensive model assessment across a wide range of land variables and generates a hierarchical set of web pages containing statistical analyses and figures designed to provide the user insights into strengths and weaknesses of multiple models or model versions. Described here is the benchmarking philosophy and mathematical methodology embodied in the most recent implementation of the ILAMB package. Comparison methods unique to a few specific data sets are presented, and guidelines for configuring an ILAMB analysis and interpreting resulting model performance scores are discussed. ILAMB is being adopted by modeling teams and centers during model development and for model intercomparison projects, and community engagement is sought for extending evaluation metrics and adding new observational data sets to the benchmarking framework.},

  abstract = {To constrain global warming, we must strongly curtail greenhouse gas emissions and capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide1,2. Regrowing natural forests is a prominent strategy for capturing additional carbon3, but accurate assessments of its potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in carbon accumulation rates2,3. To assess why and where rates differ, here we compile 13,112 georeferenced measurements of carbon accumulation. Climatic factors explain variation in rates better than land-use history, so we combine the field measurements with 66 environmental covariate layers to create a global, one-kilometre-resolution map of potential aboveground carbon accumulation rates for the first 30 years of natural forest regrowth. This map shows over 100-fold variation in rates across the globe, and indicates that default rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)4,5 may~underestimate aboveground carbon accumulation rates by 32 per cent on average and do not capture eight-fold variation within ecozones. Conversely, we conclude that maximum climate mitigation potential from natural forest regrowth is 11 per cent lower than previously reported3 owing to the use of overly high rates for the location of potential new forest. Although our data compilation includes more studies and sites than previous efforts, our results depend on data availability, which is concentrated in ten countries, and data quality, which varies across studies. However, the plots cover most of the environmental conditions across the areas for which we predicted carbon accumulation rates (except for northern Africa and northeast Asia). We therefore provide a robust and globally consistent tool for assessing natural forest regrowth as a climate mitigation strategy.},

Here, we examine the legacy and sustained impact of a paper long considered a classic in ecology, E.P. (Gene) Odum's 1969 ``The strategy of ecosystem development.'' Odum's paper presented testable predictions about species diversity, energy flow, and biogeochemical dynamics during ecosystem succession and provided guiding principles for environmental conservation and management. Odum's 24 predictions on ``ecosystem development'' were a key component of this paper's legacy: The framework was referenced in 62.0\% and tested in 28.7\% of 1598 citing papers we examined. Although we found that support for Odum's framework grew over time, support for any particular prediction was inconsistent, highlighting the unresolved nature of some of the framework's principles. Odum's conceptual framework for ecosystem studies\textemdash as well as his forward-thinking attempts to connect ecosystem ecology with humans and society\textemdash continues to be pertinent to current and future research frontiers. Simplicity of the framework was its strength, and major limitation, painting ecosystem functioning in broad strokes, with no acknowledgement about interactions among the predictions. Newer generations have their work cut out for them by bridging evolutionary biology and ecosystem science or metabolic theory and ecological stoichiometry. Similarly, newer generations are using Odum's multidisciplinary approach to address the most pressing global change issues and designing solutions that make the Earth life sustaining system compatible with growing human demands.},

Curtis et al. used high-resolution Google Earth imagery to map and classify global forest loss since 2001. Just over a quarter of global forest loss is due to deforestation through permanent land use change for the production of commodities, including beef, soy, palm oil, and wood fiber. Despite regional differences and efforts by governments, conservationists, and corporations to stem the losses, the overall rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined since 2001. Science, this issue p. 1108 Global maps of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27\% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26\%), shifting agriculture (24\%), and wildfire (23\%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year. A high-resolution global map enables a classification of the main drivers of forest loss.

Forests cover just over 30 percent of the global land area, yet they provide habitat for the vast majority of the terrestrial plant and animal species known to science. Unfortunately, forests and the biodiversity they contain continue to be under threat from actions to convert the land to agriculture or unsustainable levels of exploitation, much of it illegal. The State of the World's Forests 2020 assesses progress to date in meeting global targets and goals related to forest biodiversity and examines the effectiveness of policies, actions and approaches, in terms of both conservation and sustainable development outcomes.

A new era of data-model integration requires investment in accessible, scalable, and transparent tools that integrate the expertise of the whole community, including both modelers and empiricists. This roadmap focuses on five key opportunities for community tools: the underlying foundations of community cyberinfrastructure; data ingest; calibration of models to data; model-data benchmarking; and data assimilation and ecological forecasting. This community-driven approach is a key to meeting the pressing needs of science and society in the 21st century.},

A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1\textdegree{} and 1.5\textdegree C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere \textendash{} the ``global carbon budget'' \textendash{} is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO\textsubscript{2} emissions (\emph{E}\textsubscript{FF}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use change (\emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (\emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN}) and terrestrial CO\textsubscript{2} sink (\emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (\emph{B}\textsubscript{IM}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {$\pm$}1\emph{{$\sigma$}}. For the last decade available (2009\textendash 2018), \emph{E}\textsubscript{FF} was 9.5{$\pm$}0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} 1.5{$\pm$}0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} 4.9{$\pm$}0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.3{$\pm$}0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} 2.5{$\pm$}0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} 3.2{$\pm$}0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a budget imbalance \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.4\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2018 alone, the growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FF} was about 2.1\&thinsp;\% and fossil emissions increased to 10.0{$\pm$}0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, reaching 10\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} for the first time in history, \emph{E}\textsubscript{LUC} was 1.5{$\pm$}0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, for total anthropogenic CO\textsubscript{2} emissions of 11.5{$\pm$}0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (42.5{$\pm$}3.3\&thinsp;GtCO\textsubscript{2}). Also for 2018, \emph{G}\textsubscript{ATM} was 5.1{$\pm$}0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} (2.4{$\pm$}0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}), \emph{S}\textsubscript{OCEAN} was 2.6{$\pm$}0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and \emph{S}\textsubscript{LAND} was 3.5{$\pm$}0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}, with a \emph{B}\textsubscript{IM} of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration reached 407.38{$\pm$}0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2018. For 2019, preliminary data for the first 6\textendash 10 months indicate a reduced growth in \emph{E}\textsubscript{FF} of +0.6\&thinsp;\% (range of -0.2\&thinsp;\% to 1.5\&thinsp;\%) based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. Overall, the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\textendash 2018, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO\textsubscript{2} fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO\textsubscript{2} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO\textsubscript{2} variability by ocean models outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qu\'er\'e et al., 2018a, b, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).

Here, we show that a range of ecosystems contain `irrecoverable carbon' that is vulnerable to release upon land use conversion and, once lost, is not recoverable on timescales relevant to avoiding dangerous climate impacts. Globally, ecosystems highly affected by human land-use decisions contain at least 260 Gt of irrecoverable carbon, with particularly high densities in peatlands, mangroves, old-growth forests and marshes. To achieve climate goals, we must safeguard these irrecoverable carbon pools through an expanded set of policy and finance strategies.},

Assuming full implementation of (I)NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990\textendash 2010 (1.3 {$\pm$} 1.1 GtCO2e yr-1) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to -1.1 {$\pm$} 0.5 GtCO2e yr-1), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries. Realizing and tracking this mitigation potential requires more transparency in countries' pledges and enhanced science-policy cooperation to increase confidence in numbers, including reconciling the {$\approx$}3 GtCO2e yr-1 difference in estimates between country reports and scientific studies.},

Uncertainty remains about how these short-term plot-level responses might play out over broader temporal and spatial scales where climate change, competition, succession, and disturbances interact with tree-level responses. In this study, we used a new physiology-based approach (PnET-Succession v3.1) within the forest landscape model LANDIS-II to extrapolate the FACE results to broader temporal scales (and ultimately to landscape scale) by mechanistically accounting for the globally changing drivers of temperature, precipitation, CO2, and ozone. We added novel algorithms to the model to mechanistically simulate the effects of ozone on photosynthesis through ozone-induced impairment of stomatal control (i.e., stomatal sluggishness) and damage of photosynthetic capacity at the chloroplast level.},

This chapter reviews the rates at which CWD is added and removed from ecosystems, the biomass found in streams and forests, and many functions that CWD serves. CWD is added to ecosystems by numerous mechanisms, including wind, fire, insect attack, pathogens, competition, and geomorphic processes. Despite the many long-term studies on tree mortality, there are few published rates of CWD input on mass-area-1 time-1 basis. CWD is significantly transformed physically and chemically. Movement of CWD, especially in streams, is also an important but poorly documented mechanism whereby CWD is lost from ecosystems. Many factors control the rate at which CWD decomposes, including temperature, moisture, internal gas composition of CWD, substrate quality, size of CWD, and types of organisms involved. However, the importance of many of these factors has yet to be established in field experiments. CWD performs many functions in ecosystems, serving as autotrophic and heterotrophic habitat and strongly influencing geomorphic processes, especially in streams. It is also a major component of nutrient cycles in many ecosystems and is an important functional component of stream and forest ecosystems.},

To date, several forest carbon monitoring systems have been developed for different regions using various data, methods and assumptions, making it difficult to evaluate mitigation performance consistently across scales. Here, we integrate ground and Earth observation data to map annual forest-related greenhouse gas emissions and removals globally at a spatial resolution of 30\,m over the years 2001\textendash 2019. We estimate that global forests were a net carbon sink of -7.6\,{$\pm$}\,49\,GtCO2e\,yr-1, reflecting a balance between gross carbon removals (-15.6\,{$\pm$}\,49\,GtCO2e\,yr-1) and gross emissions from deforestation and other disturbances (8.1\,{$\pm$}\,2.5\,GtCO2e\,yr-1). The geospatial monitoring framework introduced here supports climate policy development by promoting alignment and transparency in setting priorities and tracking collective progress towards forest-specific climate mitigation goals with both local detail and global consistency. Forest management for climate mitigation plans requires accurate data on carbon fluxes to monitor policy impacts. Between 2001 and 2019, forests were a net sink of carbon globally, although emissions from disturbances highlight the need to reduce deforestation in tropical countries.},

  abstract = {To understand how environmental changes have influenced forest productivity, stemwood biomass (B) dynamics were analyzed at 1267 permanent inventory plots, covering a combined 209~ha area of unmanaged temperate-maritime forest in southwest British Columbia, Canada. Net stemwood production ({$\Delta$}B) was derived from periodic remeasurements of B collected over a 40-year measurement period (1959\textendash 1998) in stands ranging from 20 to 150~years old. Comparison between the integrated age response of net stemwood production, {$\Delta$}B(A), and the age response of stemwood biomass, B(A), suggested a 58~{$\pm~$}11\% increase in {$\Delta$}B between the first 40~years of the chronosequence period (1859\textendash 1898) and the measurement period. To estimate extrinsic forcing on {$\Delta$}B, several different candidate models were developed to remove variation explained by intrinsic factors. All models exhibited temporal bias, with positive trends in (observed minus predicted) residual {$\Delta$}B ranging between of 0.40 and 0.64\%~yr-1. Applying the same methods to stemwood growth (G) indicated residual increases ranging from 0.43 and 0.67\%~yr-1. Higher trend estimates corresponded with models that included site index (SI) as a predictor, which may reflect exaggeration of the age-decline in SI tables. Choosing a model that excluded SI, suggested that {$\Delta$}B increased by 0.40~{$\pm~$}0.18\%~yr-1, while G increased by 0.43~{$\pm~$}0.12\%~yr-1 over the measurement period. Residual G was significantly correlated with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature (T), and climate moisture index (CMI). However, models driven with climate and CO2, alone, could not simultaneously explain long-term and measurement-period trends without additional representation of indirect effects, perhaps reflecting compound interest on direct physiological responses to environmental change. Evidence of accelerating forest regrowth highlights the value of permanent inventories to detect and understand systematic changes in forest productivity caused by environmental change.},

  abstract = {The Global Carbon Project (GCP) has published global carbon budgets annually since 2007 (Canadell et al. [2007], Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, 18866\textendash 18870; Raupach et al. [2007], Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, 10288\textendash 10293). There are many scientists involved, but the terrestrial fluxes that appear in the budgets are not well understood by ecologists and biogeochemists outside of that community. The purpose of this paper is to make the terrestrial fluxes of carbon in those budgets more accessible to a broader community. The GCP budget is composed of annual perturbations from pre-industrial conditions, driven by addition of carbon to the system from combustion of fossil fuels and by transfers of carbon from land to the atmosphere as a result of land use. The budget includes a term for each of the major fluxes of carbon (fossil fuels, oceans, land) as well as the rate of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. Land is represented by two terms: one resulting from direct anthropogenic effects (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry or land management) and one resulting from indirect anthropogenic (e.g., CO2, climate change) and natural effects. Each of these two net terrestrial fluxes of carbon, in turn, is composed of opposing gross emissions and removals (e.g., deforestation and forest regrowth). Although the GCP budgets have focused on the two net terrestrial fluxes, they have paid little attention to the gross components, which are important for a number of reasons, including understanding the potential for land management to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and understanding the processes responsible for the sink for carbon on land. In contrast to the net fluxes of carbon, which are constrained by the global carbon budget, the gross fluxes are largely unconstrained, suggesting that there is more uncertainty than commonly believed about how terrestrial carbon emissions will respond to future fossil fuel emissions and a changing climate.},

Accurate estimations of global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can improve the understanding of global carbon dynamics and help to quantify anthropogenic carbon emissions. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques have been proven that can accurately capture both horizontal and vertical forest structures and increase the accuracy of forest AGB estimation. In this study, we mapped the global forest AGB density at a 1-km resolution through the integration of ground inventory data, optical imagery, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System/Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data, climate surfaces, and topographic data. Over 4000 ground inventory records were collected from published literatures to train the forest AGB estimation model and validate the resulting global forest AGB product. Our wall-to-wall global forest AGB map showed that the global forest AGB density was 210.09 Mg/ha on average, with a standard deviation of 109.31 Mg/ha. At the continental level, Africa (333.34 {$\pm$} 63.80 Mg/ha) and South America (301.68 {$\pm$} 67.43 Mg/ha) had higher AGB density. The AGB density in Asia, North America and Europe were 172.28 {$\pm$} 94.75, 166.48 {$\pm$} 84.97, and 132.97 {$\pm$} 50.70 Mg/ha, respectively. The wall-to-wall forest AGB map was evaluated at plot level using independent plot measurements. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between our predicted results and the validation plots were 0.56 and 87.53 Mg/ha, respectively. At the ecological zone level, the R2 and RMSE between our map and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested values were 0.56 and 101.21 Mg/ha, respectively. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison was also conducted between our forest AGB map and other published regional AGB products. Overall, our forest AGB map showed good agreements with these regional AGB products, but some of the regional AGB products tended to underestimate forest AGB density.},

  abstract = {Amazon deforestation contributes significantly to global carbon (C) emissions. In comparison, the contribution from selective logging to atmospheric CO2 emissions, and its impact on regional C dynamics, is highly uncertain. Using a new geographically based modeling approach in combination with high resolution remote sensing data from 1999 to 2002, we estimate that C emissions were 0.04\textendash 0.05 Pg C yr-1 due to selective logging from a {$\sim$}2,664,960 km2 region of the Brazilian Amazon. Selective logging was responsible for 15\textendash 19\% higher carbon emissions than reported from deforestation (clear-cutting) alone. Our simulations indicated that forest carbon lost via selective logging lasts two to three decades following harvest, and that the original live biomass takes up to a century to recover, if the forests are not subsequently cleared. The two- to three-decade loss of carbon results from the biomass damaged by logging activities, including leaves, wood, and roots, estimated to be 89.1 Tg C yr-1 from 1999 to 2002 over the study region, leaving 70.0 Tg C yr-1 and 7.9 Tg C yr-1 to accumulate as coarse woody debris and soil C, respectively. While avoided deforestation is central to crediting rain forest nations for reduced carbon emissions, the extent and intensity of selective logging are also critical to determining carbon emissions in the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). We show that a combination of automated high-resolution satellite monitoring and detailed forest C modeling can yield spatially explicit estimates of harvest-related C losses and subsequent recovery in support of REDD and other international carbon market mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) is a major pathway by which fixed carbon in the biosphere is returned to the atmosphere, yet there are limits to our ability to predict respiration rates using environmental drivers at the global scale. While temperature, moisture, carbon supply, and other site characteristics are known to regulate soil respiration rates at plot scales within certain biomes, quantitative frameworks for evaluating the relative importance of these factors across different biomes and at the global scale require tests of the relationships between field estimates and global climatic data. This study evaluates the factors driving Rs at the global scale by linking global datasets of soil moisture, soil temperature, primary productivity, and soil carbon estimates with observations of annual Rs from the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB). We find that calibrating models with parabolic soil moisture functions can improve predictive power over similar models with asymptotic functions of mean annual precipitation. Soil temperature is comparable with previously reported air temperature observations used in predicting Rs and is the dominant driver of Rs in global models; however, within certain biomes soil moisture and soil carbon emerge as dominant predictors of Rs. We identify regions where typical temperature-driven responses are further mediated by soil moisture, precipitation, and carbon supply and regions in which environmental controls on high Rs values are difficult to ascertain due to limited field data. Because soil moisture integrates temperature and precipitation dynamics, it can more directly constrain the heterotrophic component of Rs, but global-scale models tend to smooth its spatial heterogeneity by aggregating factors that increase moisture variability within and across biomes. We compare statistical and mechanistic models that provide independent estimates of global Rs ranging from 83 to 108 Pg yr-1, but also highlight regions of uncertainty where more observations are required or environmental controls are hard to constrain.},

Field-measured soil respiration (RS, the soil-to-atmosphere CO2 flux) observations were compiled into a global soil respiration database (SRDB) a decade ago, a resource that has been widely used by the biogeochemistry community to advance our understanding of RS dynamics. Novel carbon cycle sciences questions require updated and augmented global information with better interoperability among datasets. Here, we restructured and updated the global RS database to version SRDB-V5. The updated version has all previous fields revised for consistency and simplicity, and it has several new fields to include ancillary information (e.g., RS measurement time, collar insertion depth, collar area). The new SRDB-V5 includes published papers through 2017 (800 independent studies) where total observations increased from 6633 in SRDB-V4 to 10366 in SRDB-V5. The SRDB-V5 features more RS data published in Russian and Chinese scientific literature, has an improved global spatio-temporal coverage, and improved global climate-space representation. We also restructured the database so that it has stronger interoperability with other datasets related to carbon-cycle science. For instance, linking SRDB-V5 with an hourly timescale global soil respiration database (HGRsD) and an open community database for continuous soil respiration and other chamber flux data (COSORE) enables researchers to explore new questions. The updated SRDB-V5 aims to be a data framework for the scientific community to share seasonal to annual field RS measurements, and it provides opportunities for the biogeochemistry community to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of RS, its components, and the overall carbon cycle.

We focused on three likely influences on ABA for which data are readily available. climate, soil texture, and forest type. Growing-season degree-years (GSDY, stand age x growing-season length x growing-season temperature) generally predicted ABA better than stand age alone. Using regression analyses and slope homogeneity tests, we determined that broadleaf forest plots on sandy textured soils exhibited slower GSDY-adjusted ABA than those on nonsandy soils. On nonsandy soils, the GSDY-adjusted ABAs of tropical and nontropical plots were indistinguishable; tropical forest post-disturbance ABA was not particularly slow. Compared to broadleaf forests, needle-leaf forest, GSDY-adjusted ABA was less sensitive to soil texture and was intermediate in rate between sandy and nonsandy broadleaf forest ABA. Foliar nutrient concentration did not significantly influence the GSDY-adjusted ABA of a subset of the nonsandy broadleaf forests for which foliar nutrient data were available. At the global scale, differences in climate (represented by growing-season length and temperature) and moisture-holding capacity (represented by soil texture) are the principal independent factors influencing ABA in most post-disturbance secondary forests.},

  abstract = {Within the past decade, several global land cover data sets derived from satellite observations have become available to the scientific community. They offer valuable information on the current state of the Earth's land surface. However, considerable disagreements among them and classification legends not primarily suited for specific applications such as carbon cycle model parameterizations pose significant challenges and uncertainties in the use of such data sets. This paper addresses the user community of global land cover products. We first review and compare several global land cover products, i.e. the Global Land Cover Characterization Database (GLCC), Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000), and the MODIS land cover product, and highlight individual strengths and weaknesses of mapping approaches. Our overall objective is to present a straightforward method that merges existing products into a desired classification legend. This process follows the idea of convergence of evidence and generates a `best-estimate' data set using fuzzy agreement. We apply our method to develop a new joint 1-km global land cover product (SYNMAP) with improved characteristics for land cover parameterization of the carbon cycle models that reduces land cover uncertainties in carbon budget calculations. The overall advantage of the SYNMAP legend is that all classes are properly defined in terms of plant functional type mixtures, which can be remotely sensed and include the definitions of leaf type and longevity for each class with a tree component. SYNMAP is currently used for parameterization in a European model intercomparison initiative of three global vegetation models: BIOME-BGC, LPJ, and ORCHIDEE. Corroboration of SYNMAP against GLCC, GLC2000 and MODIS land cover products reveals improved agreement of SYNMAP with all other land cover products and therefore indicates the successful exploration of synergies between the different products. However, given that we cannot provide extensive validation using reference data we are unable to prove that SYNMAP is actually more accurate. SYNMAP is available on request from Martin Jung.},

We combine net ecosystem productivity estimates from atmospheric inversions of the NASA Carbon Monitoring System-Flux (CMS-Flux) with an optimally scaled gross primary productivity dataset based on satellite-observed solar-induced fluorescence variations to estimate total ecosystem respiration as a residual of the terrestrial carbon balance. The ecosystem respiration is then separated into autotrophic and heterotrophic components based on a spatially varying carbon use efficiency retrieved in a model\textendash data fusion framework (the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework, CARDAMOM). The resulting dataset is independent of any assumptions about how heterotrophic respiration responds to climate or substrate variations. It estimates an annual average global average heterotrophic respiration flux of 43.6{$\pm$}19.3\&thinsp;Pg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses showed that the top-down \emph{R}\textsubscript{h} are more sensitive to the choice of input gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) datasets than to the assumption of a static carbon use efficiency (CUE) value, with the possible exception of the wet tropics. These top-down estimates are compared to bottom-up estimates of annual heterotrophic respiration, using new uncertainty estimates that partially account for sampling and model errors. Top-down heterotrophic respiration estimates are higher than those from bottom-up upscaling everywhere except at high latitudes and are 30\&thinsp;\% greater overall (43.6\&thinsp;Pg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} vs. 33.4\&thinsp;Pg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}).

The ratio of top-down heterotrophic to total ecosystem respiration varies seasonally by as much as 0.6 depending on season and climate, illustrating the importance of studying the drivers of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration separately, and thus the importance of data-driven estimates of \emph{R}\textsubscript{h} such as those estimated here.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, the carbon uptake potential in land-based climate change mitigation efforts is highly uncertain. Here, we address this uncertainty by using two land-based mitigation scenarios from two land-use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) as input to four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs; LPJ-GUESS, ORCHIDEE, JULES, LPJmL). Each of the four combinations of land-use models and mitigation scenarios aimed for a cumulative carbon uptake of 130 GtC by the end of the century, achieved either via the cultivation of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or avoided deforestation and afforestation (ADAFF). Results suggest large uncertainty in simulated future land demand and carbon uptake rates, depending on the assumptions related to land use and land management in the models. Total cumulative carbon uptake in the DGVMs is highly variable across mitigation scenarios, ranging between 19 and 130 GtC by year 2099. Only one out of the 16 combinations of mitigation scenarios and DGVMs achieves an equivalent or higher carbon uptake than achieved in the land-use models. The large differences in carbon uptake between the DGVMs and their discrepancy against the carbon uptake in IMAGE and MAgPIE are mainly due to different model assumptions regarding bioenergy crop yields and due to the simulation of soil carbon response to land-use change. Differences between land-use models and DGVMs regarding forest biomass and the rate of forest regrowth also have an impact, albeit smaller, on the results. Given the low confidence in simulated carbon uptake for a given land-based mitigation scenario, and that negative emissions simulated by the DGVMs are typically lower than assumed in scenarios consistent with the 2\textdegree C target, relying on negative emissions to mitigate climate change is a highly uncertain strategy.},

  abstract = {Five main biogenic sources of CO2 efflux from soils have been distinguished and described according to their turnover rates and the mean residence time of carbon. They are root respiration, rhizomicrobial respiration, decomposition of plant residues, the priming effect induced by root exudation or by addition of plant residues, and basal respiration by microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). These sources can be grouped in several combinations to summarize CO2 efflux from the soil including: root-derived CO2, plant-derived CO2, SOM-derived CO2, rhizosphere respiration, heterotrophic microbial respiration (respiration by heterotrophs), and respiration by autotrophs. These distinctions are important because without separation of SOM-derived CO2 from plant-derived CO2, measurements of total soil respiration have very limited value for evaluation of the soil as a source or sink of atmospheric CO2 and for interpreting the sources of CO2 and the fate of carbon within soils and ecosystems. Additionally, the processes linked to the five sources of CO2 efflux from soil have various responses to environmental variables and consequently to global warming. This review describes the basic principles and assumptions of the following methods which allow SOM-derived and root-derived CO2 efflux to be separated under laboratory and field conditions: root exclusion techniques, shading and clipping, tree girdling, regression, component integration, excised roots and in situ root respiration; continuous and pulse labeling, 13C natural abundance and FACE, and radiocarbon dating and bomb-14C. A short sections cover the separation of the respiration of autotrophs and that of heterotrophs, i.e. the separation of actual root respiration from microbial respiration, as well as methods allowing the amount of CO2 evolved by decomposition of plant residues and by priming effects to be estimated. All these methods have been evaluated according to their inherent disturbance of the ecosystem and C fluxes, and their versatility under various conditions. The shortfalls of existing approaches and the need for further development and standardization of methods are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Accurately quantifying gross primary production (GPP) globally is critical for assessing plant productivity, carbon balance, and carbon-climate feedbacks, while current GPP estimates exhibit substantial uncertainty. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has offered unprecedented opportunities for monitoring land photosynthesis, while its sparse coverage remains a bottleneck for mapping finer-resolution GPP globally. Here, we used the global, OCO-2-based SIF product (GOSIF) and linear relationships between SIF and GPP to map GPP globally at a 0.05\&deg; spatial resolution and 8-day time step for the period from 2000 to 2017. To account for the uncertainty of GPP estimates resulting from the SIF-GPP relationship, we used a total of eight SIF-GPP relationships with different forms (universal and biome-specific, with and without intercept) at both site and grid cell levels to estimate GPP. Our results showed that all of the eight SIF-GPP relationships performed well in estimating GPP globally. The ensemble mean 8-day GPP was generally highly correlated with flux tower GPP for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe (R2 = 0.74, Root Mean Square Error = 1.92 g C m\&minus;2 d\&minus;1). Our fine-resolution GPP estimates showed reasonable spatial and seasonal variations across the globe and fully captured both seasonal cycles and spatial patterns present in our coarse-resolution (1\&deg;) GPP estimates based on coarse-resolution SIF data directly aggregated from discrete OCO-2 soundings. SIF-GPP relationships with different forms could lead to significant differences in annual GPP particularly in the tropics. Our ensemble global annual GPP estimate (135.5 \&plusmn; 8.8 Pg C yr\&minus;1) is between the median estimate of non-process based methods and the median estimate of process-based models. Our GPP estimates showed interannual variability in many regions and exhibited increasing trends in many parts of the globe particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. With the availability of high-quality, gridded SIF observations from space (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX), our novel approach does not rely on any other input data (e.g., climate data, soil properties) and therefore can map GPP solely based on satellite SIF observations and potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates at regional to global scales. The use of a universal SIF-GPP relationship versus biome-specific relationships can also avoid the uncertainty associated with land cover maps. Our novel, independent GPP product (GOSIF GPP), freely available at our data repository, will be valuable for studying photosynthesis, carbon cycle, agricultural production, and ecosystem responses to climate change and disturbances, informing ecosystem management, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.},

We used data from the United States (US) Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, and a literature database on old-growth biomass, to quantify late-successional biomass trajectories in different US forest types. Our results suggest that late-successional biomass declines are rare in US forests.

We quantified the impacts of the 2011 and 2012 droughts on terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake anomalies over the contiguous US (CONUS) relative to non-drought years during 2010\textendash 2015 using satellite observations and the carbon monitoring system\textemdash flux inversion modeling framework. Soil moisture and temperature anomalies are good predictors of gross primary production anomalies (R2 {$>$} 0.6) in summer but less so for net biosphere production (NBP) anomalies, reflecting different respiration responses. We showed that regional responses combine in complicated ways to produce the observed CONUS responses. Because of the compensating effect of the carbon flux anomalies between northern and southern CONUS in 2011 and between spring and summer in 2012, the annual NBP decreased by 0.10 {$\pm$} 0.16 GtC in 2011, and increased by 0.10 {$\pm$} 0.16 GtC in 2012 over CONUS, consistent with previous reported results. Over the 2011 and 2012 drought-impacted regions, the reductions in NBP were {$\sim$}40\% of the regional annual fossil fuel emissions, underscoring the importance of quantifying natural carbon flux variability as part of an overall observing strategy. The NBP reductions over the 2011 and 2012 CONUS drought-impacted region were opposite to the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate anomaly, implying that global atmospheric CO2 growth rate is an offsetting effect between enhanced uptake and emission, and enhancing the understanding of regional carbon-cycle climate relationship is necessary to improve the projections of future climate.},

  abstract = {Land models, which have been developed by the modeling community in the past few decades to predict future states of ecosystems and climate, have to be critically evaluated for their performance skills of simulating ecosystem responses and feedback to climate change. Benchmarking is an emerging procedure to measure performance of models against a set of defined standards. This paper proposes a benchmarking framework for evaluation of land model performances and, meanwhile, highlights major challenges at this infant stage of benchmark analysis. The framework includes (1) targeted aspects of model performance to be evaluated, (2) a set of benchmarks as defined references to test model performance, (3) metrics to measure and compare performance skills among models so as to identify model strengths and deficiencies, and (4) model improvement. Land models are required to simulate exchange of water, energy, carbon and sometimes other trace gases between the atmosphere and land surface, and should be evaluated for their simulations of biophysical processes, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation dynamics in response to climate change across broad temporal and spatial scales. Thus, one major challenge is to select and define a limited number of benchmarks to effectively evaluate land model performance. The second challenge is to develop metrics of measuring mismatches between models and benchmarks. The metrics may include (1) a priori thresholds of acceptable model performance and (2) a scoring system to combine data\textendash model mismatches for various processes at different temporal and spatial scales. The benchmark analyses should identify clues of weak model performance to guide future development, thus enabling improved predictions of future states of ecosystems and climate. The near-future research effort should be on development of a set of widely acceptable benchmarks that can be used to objectively, effectively, and reliably evaluate fundamental properties of land models to improve their prediction performance skills.},

  abstract = {Aim To examine the contribution of large-diameter trees to biomass, stand structure, and species richness across forest biomes. Location Global. Time period Early 21st century. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We examined the contribution of large trees to forest density, richness and biomass using a global network of 48 large (from 2 to 60 ha) forest plots representing 5,601,473 stems across 9,298 species and 210 plant families. This contribution was assessed using three metrics: the largest 1\% of trees {$\geq$} 1 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), all trees {$\geq$} 60 cm DBH, and those rank-ordered largest trees that cumulatively comprise 50\% of forest biomass. Results Averaged across these 48 forest plots, the largest 1\% of trees {$\geq$} 1 cm DBH comprised 50\% of aboveground live biomass, with hectare-scale standard deviation of 26\%. Trees {$\geq$} 60 cm DBH comprised 41\% of aboveground live tree biomass. The size of the largest trees correlated with total forest biomass (r2 = .62, p {$<$} .001). Large-diameter trees in high biomass forests represented far fewer species relative to overall forest richness (r2 = .45, p {$<$} .001). Forests with more diverse large-diameter tree communities were comprised of smaller trees (r2 = .33, p {$<$} .001). Lower large-diameter richness was associated with large-diameter trees being individuals of more common species (r2 = .17, p = .002). The concentration of biomass in the largest 1\% of trees declined with increasing absolute latitude (r2 = .46, p {$<$} .001), as did forest density (r2 = .31, p {$<$} .001). Forest structural complexity increased with increasing absolute latitude (r2 = .26, p {$<$} .001). Main conclusions Because large-diameter trees constitute roughly half of the mature forest biomass worldwide, their dynamics and sensitivities to environmental change represent potentially large controls on global forest carbon cycling. We recommend managing forests for conservation of existing large-diameter trees or those that can soon reach large diameters as a simple way to conserve and potentially enhance ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems sequester 2.1 Pg of atmospheric carbon annually. A large amount of the terrestrial sink is realized by forests. However, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of this carbon over both short and long timescales. Relevant data to address these uncertainties are being collected at many sites around the world, but syntheses of these data are still sparse. To facilitate future synthesis activities, we have assembled a comprehensive global database for forest ecosystems, which includes carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (e.g. leaf area index, age), as well as ancillary site information such as management regime, climate, and soil characteristics. This publicly available database can be used to quantify global, regional or biome-specific carbon budgets; to re-examine established relationships; to test emerging hypotheses about ecosystem functioning [e.g. a constant net ecosystem production (NEP) to gross primary production (GPP) ratio]; and as benchmarks for model evaluations. In this paper, we present the first analysis of this database. We discuss the climatic influences on GPP, net primary production (NPP) and NEP and present the CO2 balances for boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes based on micrometeorological, ecophysiological, and biometric flux and inventory estimates. Globally, GPP of forests benefited from higher temperatures and precipitation whereas NPP saturated above either a threshold of 1500 mm precipitation or a mean annual temperature of 10 \textdegree C. The global pattern in NEP was insensitive to climate and is hypothesized to be mainly determined by nonclimatic conditions such as successional stage, management, site history, and site disturbance. In all biomes, closing the CO2 balance required the introduction of substantial biome-specific closure terms. Nonclosure was taken as an indication that respiratory processes, advection, and non-CO2 carbon fluxes are not presently being adequately accounted for.},

Here the carbon isotope composition ({$\delta$}13C) of soil respiration ({$\delta$}J) was monitored in the decade after disturbance for forests affected naturally by mountain pine beetle infestation and artificially by stem girdling. The seasonal mean {$\delta$}J changed along both chronosequences. We found (a) enrichment of {$\delta$}J relative to controls ({$<$}1 \textperthousand ) in near-surface soils in the first 2 years after disturbance; (b) depletion (1\textperthousand{} or no change) during years 3\textendash 7; and (c) a second period of enrichment (1\textendash 2\textperthousand ) in years 8\textendash 10. Results were consistent with isotopic patterns associated with the gradual death and decomposition of rhizosphere organisms, fine roots, conifer needles and woody roots and debris over the course of a decade after mortality. Finally, {$\delta$}J was progressively more 13C-depleted deeper in the soil than near the surface, while the bulk soil followed the well-established pattern of 13C-enrichment at depth. Overall, differences in {$\delta$}J between mortality classes ({$<$}1\textperthousand ) and soil depths ({$<$}3\textperthousand ) were smaller than variability within a class or depth over a season (up to 6\textperthousand ).},

  abstract = {Shifting forest dynamics Forest dynamics are the processes of recruitment, growth, death, and turnover of the constituent tree species of the forest community. These processes are driven by disturbances both natural and anthropogenic. McDowell et al. review recent progress in understanding the drivers of forest dynamics and how these are interacting and changing in the context of global climate change. The authors show that shifts in forest dynamics are already occurring, and the emerging pattern is that global forests are tending toward younger stands with faster turnover as old-growth forest with stable dynamics are dwindling. Science, this issue p. eaaz9463 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDForest dynamics arise from the interplay of chronic drivers and transient disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality. The resulting trajectories of vegetation development drive the biomass and species composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Forest dynamics are changing because of anthropogenic-driven exacerbation of chronic drivers, such as rising temperature and CO2, and increasing transient disturbances, including wildfire, drought, windthrow, biotic attack, and land-use change. There are widespread observations of increasing tree mortality due to changing climate and land use, as well as observations of growth stimulation of younger forests due to CO2 fertilization. These antagonistic processes are co-occurring globally, leaving the fate of future forests uncertain. We examine the implications of changing forest demography and its drivers for both future forest management and forecasting impacts of global climate forcing. ADVANCESWe reviewed the literature of forest demographic responses to chronic drivers and transient disturbances to generate hypotheses on future trajectories of these factors and their subsequent impacts on vegetation dynamics, with a focus on forested ecosystems. We complemented this review with analyses of global land-use change and disturbance datasets to independently evaluate the implications of changing drivers and disturbances on global-scale tree demographics. Ongoing changes in environmental drivers and disturbance regimes are consistently increasing mortality and forcing forests toward shorter-statured and younger stands, reducing potential carbon storage. Acclimation, adaptation, and migration may partially mitigate these effects. These increased forest impacts are due to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, windthrow, insect or pathogen outbreaks) and land-use change, both of which are predicted to increase in magnitude in the future. Atmospherically derived estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink and remote sensing data indicate that tree growth and potentially recruitment may have increased globally in the 20th century, but the growth of this carbon sink has slowed. Variability in growth stimulation due to CO2 fertilization is evident globally, with observations and experiments suggesting that forests benefit from CO2 primarily in early stages of secondary succession. Furthermore, increased tree growth typically requires sufficient water and nutrients to take advantage of rising CO2. Collectively, the evidence reveals that it is highly likely that tree mortality rates will continue to increase, whereas recruitment and growth will respond to changing drivers in a spatially and temporally variable manner. The net impact will be a reduction in forest canopy cover and biomass. OUTLOOKPervasive shifts in forest vegetation dynamics are already occurring and are likely to accelerate under future global changes, with consequences for biodiversity and climate forcing. This conclusion is robust with respect to the abundant literature evidence and our global assessment of historical demographic changes, but it also forms the basis for hypotheses regarding the patterns and processes underlying the shifts in forest dynamics. These hypotheses will be directly testable using emerging terrestrial and satellite-based observation networks. The existing evidence and newly made observations provide a critical test of Earth system models that continue to improve in their ability to simulate forest dynamics and resulting climate forcing. Ultimately, forest managers and natural resource policies must confront the consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes to ensure sustainable forests and accrue their associated benefits. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/368/6494/eaaz9463/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A conceptual diagram of the components of forest dynamics and the disturbances that drive them.In the far-left panel, a mature ecosystem is responsive primarily to localized mortality, and the primary drivers of demography are chronically changing variables such as CO2, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In the next panel, the system is disturbed by fire, insect outbreak, or another large-scale perturbation that removes most of the overstory trees, and species adapted to rapid postdisturbance recruitment become established. In the third panel, recruitment and growth dominate demographic processes, with mortality increasing over time as competition leads to self-thinning. In the last panel, a mature ecosystem is dominated by species that have replaced the original community in response to chronic environmental changes, leading to a novel ecosystem. Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality, subsequently driving biomass and species composition. However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure. When combined, these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of changes in vegetation demographics and disturbances.},

  abstract = {Few old-growth stands remain in the matrix of secondary forests that dominates the eastern North American landscape. These remnant stands offer insight on the potential carbon (C) storage capacity of now-recovering secondary forests. We surveyed the remaining old-growth forests on sites characteristic of the general Mid-Atlantic United States and estimated the size of multiple components of forest C storage. Within and between old-growth stands, variability in C density is high and related to overstory tree species composition. The sites contain 219 {$\pm$} 46 Mg C/ha (mean {$\pm$} SD), including live and dead aboveground biomass, leaf litter, and the soil O horizon, with over 20\% stored in downed wood and snags. Stands dominated by tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) store the most live biomass, while the mixed oak (Quercus spp.) stands overall store more dead wood. Total C density is 30\% higher (154 Mg C/ha), and dead wood C density is 1800\% higher (46 Mg C/ha) in the old-growth forests than in the surrounding younger forests (120 and 5 Mg C/ha, respectively). The high density of dead wood in old growth relative to secondary forests reflects a stark difference in historical land use and, possibly, the legacy of the local disturbance (e.g., disease) history. Our results demonstrate the potential for dead wood to maintain the sink capacity of secondary forests for many decades to come.},

  abstract = {AmeriFlux scientists were early adopters of a network-enabled approach to ecosystem science that continues to transform the study of land-atmosphere interactions. In the 20 years since its formation, AmeriFlux has grown to include more than 260 flux tower sites in the Americas that support continuous observation of ecosystem carbon, water, and energy fluxes. Many of these sites are co-located within a similar climate regime, and more than 50 have data records that exceed 10 years in length. In this prospective assessment of AmeriFlux's strengths in a new era of network-enabled ecosystem science, we discuss how the longevity and spatial distribution of AmeriFlux data make them exceptionally well suited for disentangling ecosystem response to slowly evolving changes in climate and land-cover, and to rare events like droughts and biological disturbances. More recently, flux towers have also been integrated into environmental observation networks that have broader scientific goals; in North America these include the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Critical Zone Observatory network (CZO), and Long-Term Ecological Research network (LTER). AmeriFlux stands apart from these other networks in its reliance on voluntary participation of individual sites, which receive funding from diverse sources to pursue a wide, transdisciplinary array of research topics. This diffuse, grassroots approach fosters methodological and theoretical innovation, but also challenges network-level data synthesis and data sharing to the network. While AmeriFlux has had strong ties to other regional flux networks and FLUXNET, better integration with networks like NEON, CZO and LTER provides opportunities for new types of cooperation and synergies that could strengthen the scientific output of all these networks.},

  abstract = {Nearly 20\% of tropical forests are within 100 m of a nonforest edge, a consequence of rapid deforestation for agriculture. Despite widespread conversion, roughly 1.2 billion ha of tropical forest remain, constituting the largest terrestrial component of the global carbon budget. Effects of deforestation on carbon dynamics in remnant forests, and spatial variation in underlying changes in structure and function at the plant scale, remain highly uncertain. Using airborne imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, we mapped and quantified changes in forest structure and foliar characteristics along forest/oil palm boundaries in Malaysian Borneo to understand spatial and temporal variation in the influence of edges on aboveground carbon and associated changes in ecosystem structure and function. We uncovered declines in aboveground carbon averaging 22\% along edges that extended over 100 m into the forest. Aboveground carbon losses were correlated with significant reductions in canopy height and leaf mass per area and increased foliar phosphorus, three plant traits related to light capture and growth. Carbon declines amplified with edge age. Our results indicate that carbon losses along forest edges can arise from multiple, distinct effects on canopy structure and function that vary with edge age and environmental conditions, pointing to a need for consideration of differences in ecosystem sensitivity when developing land-use and conservation strategies. Our findings reveal that, although edge effects on ecosystem structure and function vary, forests neighboring agricultural plantations are consistently vulnerable to long-lasting negative effects on fundamental ecosystem characteristics controlling primary productivity and carbon storage.},

  abstract = {Around 30 Mm3 of sawlogs are extracted annually by selective logging of natural production forests in Amazonia, Earth's most extensive tropical forest. Decisions concerning the management of these production forests will be of major importance for Amazonian forests' fate. To date, no regional assessment of selective logging sustainability supports decision-making. Based on data from 3500 ha of forest inventory plots, our modelling results show that the average periodic harvests of 20 m3 ha-1 will not recover by the end of a standard 30 year cutting cycle. Timber recovery within a cutting cycle is enhanced by commercial acceptance of more species and with the adoption of longer cutting cycles and lower logging intensities. Recovery rates are faster in Western Amazonia than on the Guiana Shield. Our simulations suggest that regardless of cutting cycle duration and logging intensities, selectively logged forests are unlikely to meet timber demands over the long term as timber stocks are predicted to steadily decline. There is thus an urgent need to develop an integrated forest resource management policy that combines active management of production forests with the restoration of degraded and secondary forests for timber production. Without better management, reduced timber harvests and continued timber production declines are unavoidable.},

We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.                        ,              The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest tropical forest in the world. Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife, rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon, which is a core component of all life on Earth. Certain forms of carbon, such as the gas carbon dioxide, contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests. Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules. The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30\% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems.             Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest. This ``selective logging'' results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest, but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow. New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees. However, it is not clear how differences in the forest (for example, forest maturity), environmental factors (such as climate or soil) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon.             Piponiot et al. used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest. The models show that the forest's ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions. For example, the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable.             The findings of Piponiot et al. highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery. The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest.},

However, current large-scale maps show strong disparities, despite good validation statistics of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the validation methods, which ignore spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, leading to overoptimistic assessment of model predictive power. To illustrate this issue, we reproduce the approach of large-scale mapping studies using a massive forest inventory dataset of 11.8 million trees in central Africa to train and validate a random forest model based on multispectral and environmental variables. A standard nonspatial validation method suggests that the model predicts more than half of the forest biomass variation, while spatial validation methods accounting for SAC reveal quasi-null predictive power. This study underscores how a common practice in big data mapping studies shows an apparent high predictive power, even when predictors have poor relationships with the ecological variable of interest, thus possibly leading to erroneous maps and interpretations.},

  abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for the global carbon cycle1. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use2,3,4. Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha-1), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90\% of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha-1) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.},

  abstract = {Forest fragmentation is a ubiquitous, ongoing global phenomenon with profound impacts on the growing conditions of the world's remaining forest. The temperate broadleaf forest makes a large contribution to the global terrestrial carbon sink but is also the most heavily fragmented forest biome in the world. We use field measurements and geospatial analyses to characterize carbon dynamics in temperate broadleaf forest fragments. We show that forest growth and biomass increase by 89 {$\pm$} 17\% and 64 {$\pm$} 12\%, respectively, from the forest interior to edge, but ecosystem edge enhancements are not currently captured by models or approaches to quantifying regional C balance. To the extent that the findings from our research represent the forest of southern New England in the United States, we provide a preliminary estimate that edge growth enhancement could increase estimates of the region's carbon uptake and storage by 13 {$\pm$} 3\% and 10 {$\pm$} 1\%, respectively. However, we also find that forest growth near the edge declines three times faster than that in the interior in response to heat stress during the growing season. Using climate projections, we show that future heat stress could reduce the forest edge growth enhancement by one-third by the end of the century. These findings contrast studies of edge effects in the world's other major forest biomes and indicate that the strength of the temperate broadleaf forest carbon sink and its capacity to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions may be stronger, but also more sensitive to climate change than previous estimates suggest.},

  abstract = {Forest fragmentation is ubiquitous across urban and rural areas. While there is mounting evidence that forest fragmentation alters the terrestrial carbon cycle, the extent to which differences in ambient growing conditions between urban and rural landscapes mediate forest response to fragmentation and climate remains unexamined. This study integrates field measurements of forest structure, growth, and soil respiration with climate data and high-resolution land-cover maps to quantify forest carbon storage and sequestration patterns along edge-to-interior gradients. These data were used to contrast the response of temperate broadleaf forests to non-forest edges within rural and urban landscapes. We find that forest growth rates in both rural and urban landscapes nearly double from the forest interior to edge. Additionally, these edge-induced enhancements in forest growth are not offset by concurrent increases in total soil respiration observed across our sites. Forest productivity generally increases near edges because of increases in leaf area, but elevated air temperature at the edge tempers this response and imparts greater sensitivity of forest growth to heat. In particular, the adverse impacts of heat on forest growth are two to three times larger in urban than rural landscapes. We demonstrate that the highly fragmented nature of urban forests compared to rural forests makes them a stronger carbon sink per unit area, but also much more vulnerable to a warming climate. Collectively, our results highlight the need to include the effects of both urbanization and fragmentation when quantifying regional carbon balance and its response to a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Due to forest fragmentation, forest edges have become dominant features in landscapes around the world. Forest edges are exposed to a different microclimate in terms of air and soil temperature, light availability, soil moisture and wind speed than the forest interior. Furthermore, forest edges catch more atmospheric deposition, due to obstruction of the wind profile causing advection and turbulent exchange. Coniferous forest types are subjected to higher N deposition due to their higher Leaf Area Index (LAI), evergreen character and higher collecting efficiency of needles compared to leaves. In Europe, highest deposition values coincide with intensive livestock breeding areas, such as northern Belgium. It is still unclear how this elevated atmospheric deposition affects N and carbon (C) stocks at temperate forest edges. We assessed the N and C stocks of the aboveground (leaves/needles, wood) and belowground (forest floor, coarse and fine roots, mineral soil) forest pools along edge-to-interior transects in six forests, located in Belgium (two oak and two pine forests) and in Denmark (two spruce forests) on sandy haplic podzols. The total stocks increased towards the forest edge by 30\% for N and 43\% for C, averaged over all forests, within a confidence interval of 95\% (which was in some cases rather wide). The aboveground wood stocks increased by 56\% for N and C, the root stocks by 48\% for N and C and the mineral soil stocks increased by circa 30\% for N and C. Soil C sequestration (calculated via a static N balance based on N throughfall and leaching) increased at the forest edges, being on average 646 and 289kgha-1year-1 in the forest edge and interior, respectively. Forest type effects were less prominent than edge effects, with no amplified edge effect on N and C stocks in the coniferous forest types. Nevertheless, our results show the importance of incorporating forest edges when monitoring C storage on a landscape scale. The question arises, however, how much longer such forest edges will continue to accrue additional C when subjected to continuously high atmospheric N deposition.},

Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default {$\increment$}AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old-growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate {$\increment$}AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old-growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated {$\increment$}AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests ({$\leq$}20 years), older secondary forests ({$>$}20 years and up to 100 years) and old-growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our {$\increment$}AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg ha-1 year-1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg ha-1 year-1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg ha-1 year-1 in old-growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on {$\increment$}AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large-scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research.},

  abstract = {Wildfires strongly regulate carbon (C) cycling and storage in boreal forests and account for almost 10\% of global fire C emissions. However, the anticipated effects of climate change on fire regimes may destabilize current C-climate feedbacks and switch the systems to new stability domains. Since most of these forests are located in upland soils where permafrost is widespread, the expected climate warming and drying combined with more active fires may alter the greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets of boreal forests and trigger unprecedented changes in the global C balance. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of fires on the various spatial and temporal patterns of GHG fluxes of different physical environments (permafrost and nonpermafrost soils) is fundamental to an understanding of the role played by fire in future climate feedbacks. While large amounts of C are released during fires, postfire GHG fluxes play an important role in boreal C budgets over the short and long term. The timescale over which the vegetation cover regenerates seems to drive the recovery of C emissions after both low- and high-severity fires, regardless of fire-induced changes in soil decomposition. In soils underlain by permafrost, fires increase the active layer depth for several years, which may alter the soil dynamics regulating soil GHG exchange. In a scenario of global warming, prolonged exposition of previously immobilized C could result in higher carbon dioxide emission during the early fire succession. However, without knowledge of the contribution of each respiration component combined with assessment of the warming and drying effects on both labile and recalcitrant soil organic matter throughout the soil profile, we cannot advance on the most relevant feedbacks involving fire and permafrost. Fires seem to have either negligible effects on methane (CH4) fluxes or a slight increase in CH4 uptake. However, permafrost thawing driven by climate or fire could turn upland boreal soils into temporary CH4 sources, depending on how fast the transition from moist to drier soils occurs. Most studies indicate a slight decrease or no significant change in postfire nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, simulations have shown that the temperature sensitivity of denitrification exceeds that of soil respiration; thus, the effects of warming on soil N2O emissions may be greater than on C emissions.},

  abstract = {Developing countries are required to produce robust estimates of forest carbon stocks for successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies related to reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD). Here we present a ``benchmark'' map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49\%, 25\%, and 26\% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from {$\pm$}6\% to {$\pm$}53\%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national ({$>$}1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. {$\pm$}5\% and ca. {$\pm$}1\%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

  abstract = {Forest biomass is an essential indicator for monitoring the Earth's ecosystems and climate. It is a critical input to greenhouse gas accounting, estimation of carbon losses and forest degradation, assessment of renewable energy potential, and for developing climate change mitigation policies such as REDD+, among others. Wall-to-wall mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB) is now possible with satellite remote sensing (RS). However, RS methods require extant, up-to-date, reliable, representative and comparable in situ data for calibration and validation. Here, we present the Forest Observation System (FOS) initiative, an international cooperation to establish and maintain a global in situ forest biomass database. AGB and canopy height estimates with their associated uncertainties are derived at a 0.25\,ha scale from field measurements made in permanent research plots across the world's forests. All plot estimates are geolocated and have a size that allows for direct comparison with many RS measurements. The FOS offers the potential to improve the accuracy of RS-based biomass products while developing new synergies between the RS and ground-based ecosystem research communities.

Indeed, most of our knowledge on tropical forests arises from studies carried out in undisturbed tropical forests. This bias is problematic given that logged and disturbed tropical forests are now covering a larger area than the so-called primary forests. A new network of permanent sample plots in logged forests, the Tropical managed Forests Observatory (TmFO), aims to fill this gap by providing unprecedented opportunities to examine long-term data on the resilience of logged tropical forests at regional and global scales. TmFO currently includes 24 experimental sites distributed across three tropical regions, with a total of 490 permanent plots and 921 ha of forest inventories.},

They often only represent a single vegetation type and rarely account for carbon stocks in belowground biomass. To date, no global product integrates these disparate estimates into an all-encompassing map at a scale appropriate for many modelling or decision-making applications. We developed an approach for harmonizing vegetation-specific maps of both above and belowground biomass into a single, comprehensive representation of each. We overlaid input maps and allocated their estimates in proportion to the relative spatial extent of each vegetation type using ancillary maps of percent tree cover and landcover, and a rule-based decision schema. The resulting maps consistently and seamlessly report biomass carbon density estimates across a wide range of vegetation types in 2010 with quantified uncertainty. They do so for the globe at an unprecedented 300-meter spatial resolution and can be used to more holistically account for diverse vegetation carbon stocks in global analyses and greenhouse gas inventories.},

  abstract = {Aim An understanding of the relationship between forest biomass and climate is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on carbon stores. Biomass patterns have been characterized at geographically or climatically restricted scales, making it unclear if biomass is limited by climate in any general way at continental to global scales. Using a dataset spanning multiple climatic regions we evaluate the generality of published biomass\textendash climate correlations. We also combine metabolic theory and hydraulic limits to plant growth to first derive and then test predictions for how forest biomass should vary with maximum individual tree biomass and the ecosystem water deficit. Location Temperate forests and dry, moist and wet tropical forests across North, Central and South America. Methods A forest biomass model was derived from allometric functions and power-law size distributions. Biomass and climate were correlated using extensive forest plot (276 0.1-ha plots), wood density and climate datasets. Climate variables included mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, their ratio, precipitation of the driest quarter, potential and actual evapotranspiration, and the ecosystem water deficit. The water deficit uniquely summarizes water balance by integrating water inputs from precipitation with water losses due to solar energy. Results Climate generally explained little variation in forest biomass, and mixed support was found for published biomass\textendash climate relationships. Our theory indicated that maximum individual biomass governs forest biomass and is constrained by water deficit. Indeed, forest biomass was tightly coupled to maximum individual biomass and the upper bound of maximum individual biomass declined steeply with water deficit. Water deficit similarly constrained the upper bound of forest biomass, with most forests below the constraint. Main conclusions The results suggest that: (1) biomass\textendash climate models developed at restricted geographic/climatic scales may not hold at broader scales; (2) maximum individual biomass is strongly related to forest biomass, suggesting that process-based models should focus on maximum individual biomass; (3) the ecosystem water deficit constrains biomass, but realized biomass often falls below the constraint; such that (4) biomass is not strongly limited by climate in most forests so that forest biomass may not predictably respond to changes in mean climate.},

We explored SOC responses to warming and increased carbon inputs using a synthesis of 147 field manipulation experiments and five SOC models with different representations of microbial and mineral processes. Model projections diverged but encompassed a similar range of variability as the experimental results. Experimental measurements were insufficient to eliminate or validate individual model outcomes. While all models projected that CO2 efflux would increase and SOC stocks would decline under warming, nearly one-third of experiments observed decreases in CO2 flux and nearly half of experiments observed increases in SOC stocks under warming. Long-term measurements of C inputs to soil and their changes under warming are needed to reconcile modeled and observed patterns. Measurements separating the responses of mineral-protected and unprotected SOC fractions in manipulation experiments are needed to address key uncertainties in microbial degradation and mineral stabilization mechanisms. Integrating models with experimental design will allow targeting of these uncertainties and help to reconcile divergence among models to produce more confident projections of SOC responses to global changes.},

Estimates indicate significant reduction of deforestation emissions over the study period, albeit more slowly than previously assessed, from an average of 4.3\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;CO\textsubscript{2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} during 1991\&ndash;2000, to an average of 2.9\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;CO\textsubscript{2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} during 2016\&ndash;2020. Remaining forest land was a significant net carbon sink globally and over the entire period, albeit decreasing in strength, from \&minus;3.4\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;CO\textsubscript{2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} in 1991\&ndash;2000 to \&minus;2.5\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;CO\textsubscript{2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} during 2016\&ndash;2020. The overall net contribution of forests to atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2}(i.e., the combined effect of deforestation and forest emissions/removals) was an overall emission source of roughly 0.4\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;CO\textsubscript{2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} on average during 1991\&ndash;2020, more than one-third less than previously estimated. Remarkably, the new data also suggest an overall net sink of about \&minus;0.7\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;CO\textsubscript{2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} during 2011\&ndash;2015, never reported before. Forest emissions/removals data independently reported by countries to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change were in excellent agreement with the FAO estimates over the entire period 1990\&ndash;2020, confirming a large sink on forest land estimated for 2011\&ndash;2015.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Climate, land use, and other anthropogenic and natural drivers have the potential to influence fire dynamics in many regions. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the changing role of these drivers and their impact on atmospheric composition, long-term fire records are needed that fuse information from different satellite and in situ data streams. Here we describe the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) and quantify global fire emissions patterns during 1997\textendash 2016. The modeling system, based on the Carnegie\textendash Ames\textendash Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model, has several modifications from the previous version and uses higher quality input datasets. Significant upgrades include (1) new burned area estimates with contributions from small fires, (2) a revised fuel consumption parameterization optimized using field observations, (3) modifications that improve the representation of fuel consumption in frequently burning landscapes, and (4) fire severity estimates that better represent continental differences in burning processes across boreal regions of North America and Eurasia. The new version has a higher spatial resolution (0.25\textdegree ) and uses a different set of emission factors that separately resolves trace gas and aerosol emissions from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Global mean carbon emissions using the burned area dataset with small fires (GFED4s) were 2.2 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{15} grams of carbon per year (Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}) during 1997\textendash 2016, with a maximum in 1997 (3.0 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}) and minimum in 2013 (1.8 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}). These estimates were 11 \% higher than our previous estimates (GFED3) during 1997\textendash 2011, when the two datasets overlapped. This net increase was the result of a substantial increase in burned area (37 \%), mostly due to the inclusion of small fires, and a modest decrease in mean fuel consumption (-19 \%) to better match estimates from field studies, primarily in savannas and grasslands. For trace gas and aerosol emissions, differences between GFED4s and GFED3 were often larger due to the use of revised emission factors. If small fire burned area was excluded (GFED4 without the {$<$}q{$>$}s{$<$}/q{$>$} for small fires), average emissions were 1.5 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The addition of small fires had the largest impact on emissions in temperate North America, Central America, Europe, and temperate Asia. This small fire layer carries substantial uncertainties; improving these estimates will require use of new burned area products derived from high-resolution satellite imagery. Our revised dataset provides an internally consistent set of burned area and emissions that may contribute to a better understanding of multi-decadal changes in fire dynamics and their impact on the Earth system.

  abstract = {Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are a widely distributed vegetation type in the tropics, characterized by seasonal rainfall with several months of drought when they are subject to fire. This study is one of the first attempts to quantify above- and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB) and above- and belowground carbon (AGC and BGC) pools to calculate their recovery after fire, using a chronosequence approach (six forests that ranged form 1 to 29 years after fire and mature forest). We quantified AGB and AGC pools of trees, lianas, palms, and seedlings, and BGB and BGC pools (Oi, Oe, Oa soil horizons, and fine roots). Total AGC ranged from 0.05 to nearly 72 Mg C ha-1, BGC from 21.6 to nearly 85 Mg C ha-1, and total ecosystem carbon from 21.7 to 153.5 Mg C ha-1; all these pools increased with forest age. Nearly 50\% of the total ecosystem carbon was stored in the Oa horizon of mature forests, and up to 90\% was stored in the Oa-horizon of early successional SDTF stands. The soils were shallow with a depth of {$<$}20 cm at the study site. To recover values similar to mature forests, BGC and BGB required {$<$}19 years with accumulation rates greater than 20 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, while AGB required 80 years with accumulation rates nearly 2.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Total ecosystem biomass and carbon required 70 and 50 years, respectively, to recover values similar to mature forests. When belowground pools are not included in the calculation of total ecosystem biomass or carbon recovery, we estimated an overestimation of 10 and 30 years, respectively.},

  abstract = {Peatlands contain one-third of soil carbon (C), mostly buried in deep, saturated anoxic zones (catotelm). The response of catotelm C to climate forcing is uncertain, because prior experiments have focused on surface warming. We show that deep peat heating of a 2 m-thick peat column results in an exponential increase in CH4 emissions. However, this response is due solely to surface processes and not degradation of catotelm peat. Incubations show that only the top 20\textendash 30 cm of peat from experimental plots have higher CH4 production rates at elevated temperatures. Radiocarbon analyses demonstrate that CH4 and CO2 are produced primarily from decomposition of surface-derived modern photosynthate, not catotelm C. There are no differences in microbial abundances, dissolved organic matter concentrations or degradative enzyme activities among treatments. These results suggest that although surface peat will respond to increasing temperature, the large reservoir of catotelm C is stable under current anoxic conditions.},
