Dear Dr. Davis,

I'm please to submit the full manuscript for the invited Topical Review (ERL-105089), entitled "Carbon cycling in mature and regrowth forests globally: a macroecological synthesis based on the global Forest Carbon (ForC) database". This review draws on an unprecedented data set (11923 ForC records from 865 geographic locations representing 34 C cycle variables) to address three main questions: (1) How thoroughly can we represent C budgets for each of the world’s major forest biomes based on the current ForC data?; (2) How do C cycling vary across the world’s major forest biomes?; and (3) How does C cycling vary with stand age (in interaction with biome)?

We note that this review is strongly differentiated from prior publications using the ForC database in that (1) the size of the database has more than doubled with the recent imports of the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) and the Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment database (GROA), and (2) we synthesize global C cycle trends on a scale that has not been previously possible, simultaneously characterizing patterns in numerous variables across biomes and stand ages.

We thank you for the invitation to write this review, and look forward to receiving your feedback.

Best regards,

Kristina Anderson-Teixeira (on behalf of all authors)
